    - **Skype for Business only**
    - **Teams only**
- Set **Notify Skype for Business users that Teams is available for upgrade.**
    - If you turn this on, it will.............
- Set the **Preferred app for users to join Skype for Business meetings**  This setting determines which app is used for joining Skype for Business meetings and is honored regardless of the value of coexistence mode.
    - **Skype Meetings app (default)**
    - **Skype for Business with limited features**
- Set whether to **Download the Teams app in the background for Skype for Business users**  This setting silently downloads the Teams app for users running Skype for Business on Windows.
