# Privacy and Microsoft Teams

When an organization is considering relying on Microsoft Teams for communication and collaboration, privacy is something that needs to be addressed at every level. The questions we have below should address any privacy concerns you may have when planning your Teams implementation, or at any point during Teams usage.

## What personal data does Teams collect and how does Teams use this data?

Since Teams is a cloud-based service, various types of data are processed and stored by Microsoft as part of delivering the service. This data includes:

- **Customer Data** Customer data includes content like your meetings and conversations chats, Voice mail, shared files, recordings and transcriptions. Microsoft will never access your content.
  - **Profile Data** Data that is shared within your company about you. Examples include your E-mail address, profile picture, and phone number.
- **Call History, Call Quality** Microsoft maintains a detailed history of the phone calls you make. This allows you to go back and review your own call records. Microsoft also provides details of meetings and call data to your system administrators. This allows your admins to diagnose issues related to poor call quality and service usage. Additionally, Microsoft maintains calls records for service delivery purposes like billing and troubleshooting.
- **Support/Feedback Data** Data created when you open a trouble ticket or submit feedback to Microsoft. Microsoft commits to only using that data to resolve your issue or improve the Teams product.
- **Diagnostic and service data** Microsoft also collects various telemetry data related to service usage. This allows Microsoft to deliver the service (troubleshoot, secure and update the product, and monitor performance) as well as perform some internal business operations. Some examples of this are to:
  - Determine revenue
  - Develop metrics
  - Determine service usage
  - Conduct product and capacity planning

Microsoft Teams will only use the data provided to deliver the agreed upon services defined in the [Online Service Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2050263).

## What third parties have access to personal data?

Microsoft Teams takes strong measures to help protect your personal data from inappropriate access or use by unauthorized persons. This includes restricting access by Microsoft personnel and authorized subcontractors.  

Additionally, if you use Microsoft Teams for telephone services, Microsoft may share telephony data with other telephone companies as required to complete a phone call.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Teams does not share your data with advertiser supported services or mine it for marketing. Our policy is backed by agreements and adoption of the international code of practice for cloud privacy, **ISO-IEC 27018**.

The [Teams Security Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/security-compliance-overview#compliance-standards) has more information about our compliance standards.

## Where does Teams transfer and store personal data?

Microsoft complies with international data protection laws regarding transfers of customer data across borders. Some examples of this include:

- To allow for the continuous flow of information required by international business (including the cross-border transfer of personal data), the Teams service offer customers European Union (EU) Standard Contractual Clauses that provide additional contractual guarantees around transfers of personal data for in-scope cloud services. Our implementation of the [EU Model Clauses](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2112396) has been validated by EU data protection authorities as being in line with the rigorous privacy standards that regulate international data transfers by companies operating in its member states.
- In addition to our commitments under the Standard Contractual Clauses and other model contracts, Microsoft is certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. Microsoft participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personal data that is subject to the Microsoft Privacy Statement and is received from the EU, European Economic Area, and Switzerland.
- Microsoft also abides by Swiss data protection law regarding the processing of personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft will not transfer to any third party (not even for storage purposes) data that you provide to Microsoft through the use of our business cloud services that are covered under the [Microsoft Online Services Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2050263).

## How long does Microsoft Teams retain data?

Microsoft retains your data for the life of your account **unless that data is first deleted by you or your admin**. You have control of your own content like chat messages, e-mail. voicemail and files through your Office applications.

Additionally, your company admin may request the deletion or export of your data or profile. This ability is granted to your admin to support GDPR laws. Once you delete your Teams data (or an admin requests a delete on your behalf) Microsoft ensures that all copies of your data are deleted within 30 days. If your admin requests an export of your data, Microsoft will make the personal data that Microsoft has on you available to your admin.

If your company stops doing business with Microsoft, your data will all be deleted between 90 and 180 days of service termination.

> [!NOTE]
> In some circumstances, local laws require that Microsoft retain telephone records (for billing purposes) for a specific period of time. In those circumstances Microsoft follows the law for each region. Additionally, if a company requests that Microsoft hold a user's data to support a legal obligation, Microsoft will respect the company administrator's request.
