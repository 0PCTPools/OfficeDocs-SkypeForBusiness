# How to roll out Microsoft Teams

## Start here
Whether you're a small business or a multi-national enterprise, the best place to start for rolling out Teams is [Get started](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md). It walks you through a small-scale Teams rollout, which may be all you need if you're a small business. If you're a larger organization, use [Get started](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md) to pilot Teams with a small group of early adopters so you can learn about Teams and start planning your org-wide deployment. 

## Recommended path to Teams


We recommend rolling out Teams in stages, workload by workload, as your organization is ready. You donâ€™t have to wait until you've completed each of these steps before you move to the next. Some orgs may want to roll out all Teams features at once, while others may prefer a phased approach.

## Small business, upgrade from Skype for Business, and hybrid deployments

If you're a small business, if you're coming to Teams from Skype for Business (online or on premises), or if you need a hybrid configuration, you still want to deploy Teams following the guidance above, but you need to do some extra planning for these configurations.

|<IMG SRC="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/media/icons/hybrid-blue.svg" alt="Hybrid" height="50" width="50"><br>My organization is running Skype for Business Server, and I want to roll out Teams. |For a full-scale rollout, first you need to configure hybrid connectivity between your on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Start by reading [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity).     |
|<IMG src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/media/icons/on-premises.svg" alt="On premises" height="50" width="50"><br>I don't have Skype for Business Server, but I do have an on-premises PSTN solution. How do I integrate that with Teams?|We recommend that you use Phone System Direct Routing to hook up your on-premises PSTN solution with Teams. To get started, read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).|
