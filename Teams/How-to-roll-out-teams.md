# How to roll out Microsoft Teams

## Start here
Whether you're a small business or a giant enterprise, the best place to start for rolling out Teams is our [Quick start guide](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md). It walks you through a small-scale Teams rollout, which may be all you need if you're a small business. If you're a large enterprise, use [Quick start](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md) to pilot Teams with a small group of early adopters so you can learn about Teams and start planning your org-wide deployment. 

## Recommended path to Teams


Teams consists of 4 workloads, which you can roll out as your organization is ready. You donâ€™t have to wait until you've completed each step before you move to the next (in fact, we recommend that you start adding tabs, apps, bots, and connectors right away to customize your Teams experience). Some companies may want to roll out all Teams features at once, while others may prefer a phased approach.

If you're coming to Teams from Skype for Business (online or on premises), or if you need a hybrid configuration, we've developed guided paths for deploying Teams depending on your organization's profile. Pick your path:

|Your organization's profile|Guided path  |
|---------|---------|
|![SMB](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-SMB.png)<BR>I'm a small business with fewer than 50 users, and I'm not planning to do phone calling yet. |Just follow our [Quick start](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md), and you'll be on your way!<BR>Check out [Tabs, apps, bots, connectors](deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) - these will really enrich your Teams experience. <BR>When you're ready to add other workloads, go to [Chat, teams, & channels](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md), [Meetings](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md), and [Cloud voice](cloud-voice-landing-page.md).  |
|![journey](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-journey.png)<BR>I'm currently using Skype for Business Online, and would like to move to Teams. |Go to [Upgrade from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams](Journey-SkypeforBusiness-Teams.md).        |
|![server](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-onprem-to-teams.png)<BR>My organization is running Skype for Business Server, and I want to roll out Teams. |For a full-scale rollout, first you need to configure hybrid connectivity between your on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Start by reading [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity).     |
|![pstn to teams](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-pstn-to-teams.png)<BR>I don't have Skype for Business Server, but I do have an on-premises PSTN solution. How do I integrate that with Teams?|We recommend that you use Phone System Direct Routing to hook up your on-premises PSTN solution with Teams. To get started, read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).|
