# Welcome to Microsoft Teams

## Get started
Whether you're a small business or a giant enterprise, the best place to start for rolling out Teams is our our [Quick start guide](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md).

If you're a large enterprise, use [Quick start](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md) to pilot Teams with a small group of early adopters so you can learn about Teams and start planning your org-wide deployment.

|![enterprise](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-Enterprise.png)<BR>I'm responsible for more than 500 users, and need help to make sure that my rollout is successful. |Go to the [Teams Adoption Hub](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)] for guidance, tools, and resources to help your organization get the most out of Teams. |
|![server](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-onprem-to-teams.png)<BR>My organization is running Skype for Business Server, and I want to roll out Teams. |For a full-scale rollout, first you need to configure hybrid connectivity between your on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Start by reading [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity).     |

How do I integrate that with Teams?|We recommend that you use Phone System Direct Routing to hook up your on-premises PSTN solution with Teams. To get started, read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).|
