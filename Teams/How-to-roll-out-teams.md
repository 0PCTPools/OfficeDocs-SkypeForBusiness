# Welcome to Microsoft Teams

## Get started
Whether you're a small business or a giant enterprise, the best place to start for rolling out Teams is our our [Quick start guide](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md). It walks you through a small-scale Teams rollout, which may be all you need if you're a small business. If you're a large enterprise, use [Quick start](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md) to pilot Teams with a small group of early adopters so you can learn about Teams and start planning your org-wide deployment. 



Teams consists of 4 workloads, which you can roll out as your organization is ready. 
- [Chat, teams, & channels](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Apps, bots, tabs, connectors](deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Meetings and conferencing](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Cloud voice](cloud-voice-landing-page.md)


If you're a large enterprise, if you're coming to Teams from Skype for Business Server, or if you've got an on-premises PSTN solution, check out our [Planning guidance for large enterprises](plan-microsoft-teams-enterprise-deployment). Also for large enterprises, don't miss the [Teams Adoption Hub](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md).
