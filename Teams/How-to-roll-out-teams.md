# How to roll out Microsoft Teams

## Start here
Whether you're a small business or a giant enterprise, the best place to start for rolling out Teams is [Get started](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md). It walks you through a small-scale Teams rollout, which may be all you need if you're a small business. If you're a larger organization, use [Get started](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md) to pilot Teams with a small group of early adopters so you can learn about Teams and start planning your org-wide deployment. 

## Recommended path to Teams


Teams consists of 4 workloads, which you can roll out as your organization is ready. You donâ€™t have to wait until you've completed each step before you move to the next (in fact, we recommend that you start adding tabs, apps, bots, & connectors right away to enrich your Teams experience). Some orgs may want to roll out all Teams features at once, while others may prefer a phased approach.

## Small business, upgrade from Skype for Business, and hybrid deployments

If you're a small business, if you're coming to Teams from Skype for Business (online or on premises), or if you need a hybrid configuration, you still want to deploy Teams following the guidance above, but you need to do some extra planning for these configurations.

|![Hybrid](/office/media/icons/hybrid-blue.svg)<br>My organization is running Skype for Business Server, and I want to roll out Teams. |For a full-scale rollout, first you need to configure hybrid connectivity between your on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Start by reading [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity).     |
|![On premises](/office/media/icons/on-premises.svg)<br>I don't have Skype for Business Server, but I do have an on-premises PSTN solution. How do I integrate that with Teams?|We recommend that you use Phone System Direct Routing to hook up your on-premises PSTN solution with Teams. To get started, read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).|
