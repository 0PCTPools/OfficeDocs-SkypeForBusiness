# The Bookings app in Microsoft Teams

The Bookings app in Microsoft Teams provides a convenient way for Schedulers to schedule appointments with customers. Use the steps below to install and configure the app to start scheduling appointments.

You can access the Bookings app in two different ways:

  1. Bookings app on Teams (Available on Teams for Desktop on Windows and macOS)

  1. Bookings Web App on [https://bookings.office.com](https://bookings.office.com)

Please see the Microsoft Teams [Software and browser prerequisites](hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app.md) to verify that your systems are ready to run Teams.

## Bookings app on Teams

### Install the Bookings app

1. In Teams, click on the Apps button on the left navigation bar, then in the window that appears, search for the Bookings app.

1. In the search results, click on the Bookings tile and then click the Add button.

### Create or search for a business or department

After you install the Bookings app, a Bookings button appears in the left navigation bar. When you click this button for the first time, you are prompted to create a new business or department or to search for an existing business or department.

If you wish to create a new business or department, enter the business or department name and then select a Category. If you are searching for an existing business, select Existing Business and enter your desired business name in the search box.

> [!NOTE]
> When searching, you can type the full name or the first few letters or words of the department name. Partial search using last name or parts of the name of the business is not supported at this time.

### Add staff to the business or department

To add staff to your business or department, click the Schedule tab and then click the Add Staff button on the navigation bar. In order for staff to be added, they must have an Office 365 account.

### Designate staff as Admins or a Viewers

Staff can be designated as either Admins or Viewers. To do this, click the More Options button (the ellipsis) at the far right of the top navigation bar of the Schedule tab, then choose **Settings** \> **Staff**.

### Create an appointment type or service

Before you create an appointment or meeting, you must create an appointment type or service. These are templates for the appointment that allow you to configure confirmation messages, email reminder messages, and frequency of reminders.

1. Click on the Schedule tab for the business, then click the More Options button (the ellipsis) at the far right of the top navigation bar of the Schedule tab, then choose **Appointment types** \> **Add appointment type**.

1. Enter the relevant details for the Appointment Type template.

  > [!TIP]
  > Use clear appointment titles so that you can easily choose the correct appointment type when you need it later. For example, a doctor's office might have appointment types with titles "Initial consult" and "Screening appointment."

  You can also add additional email reminders at any frequency you require. To do this, click the "Add an email reminder" link in the Appointment Type template and make your desired changes.

1. Click the Save button when you are finished.

### Create an appointment with a customer

To create an appointment with a customer:

1. Click on the Schedule tab for the business, then click the New Booking button.

1. Choose your desired appointment type by clicking the dropdown menu in the upper left.

1. Enter all of the details of the booking, then click the Send button. An invite email is then sent to the customer.
