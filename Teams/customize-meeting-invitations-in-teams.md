# Customize meeting invitations in Microsoft Teams

As an admin, you can ensure that all Microsoft Teams meeting invitations include some helpful information your users might need, such as links to your support website and legal disclaimer, your company logo, and other text you want to include. 

## Tips for creating a logo for meeting invitations

1. Create an image that is no more than 188 pixels wide by 30 pixels tall (it's quite small).
2. Save the image in JPG format.
3. Store the image in a central location that everyone in your business can access, such as a network share, shared OneDrive for Business folder, Dropbox, and so on.

    Now you can add it to your meeting invitations. See the next steps.

## Customize your meeting invitations

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
2. From the Office 365 admin center, choose **Admin centers** > **Teams & Skype**.
3. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, choose **Meetings** > **Meeting settings**.
4. Complete the following:
    - **Logo URL** - Enter the URL where your logo is stored. Remember that it must be in JPG format!
    - **Legal URL** - If your organization has a legal website that you want people to go to if they have legal concerns, enter the URL here.
    - **Help URL** – If your organization has a support website that you want people to go to if they have problems, enter the URL here.
    - **Footer** – Enter a text-only footnote that is appropriate for your users.
5.	Select **Save**.
6.	Wait an hour or so for the changes to get populated across all Office 365 services. Then go to Outlook and schedule a Skype meeting to see what your changes look like.
