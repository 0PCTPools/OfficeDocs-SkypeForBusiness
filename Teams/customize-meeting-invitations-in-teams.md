# Customize meeting invitations in Microsoft Teams

You can customize Teams meeting invitations to meet your organization's needs. You can add your organization's logo and include helpful information, such as links to your support website and legal disclaimer, and any footer text you want to include.

## Tips for creating a logo for meeting invitations

1. Create an image that's no more than 188 pixels wide by 30 pixels tall (it's quite small). [NEEDS REVIEW]  
2. Save the image in JPG format.   
3. Store the image in a central location that everyone in your organization can access, such as a network share, shared OneDrive for Business folder, or Dropbox.
