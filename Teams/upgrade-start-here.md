# Getting started with your Microsoft Teams upgrade

## Why upgrade to Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams offers a central hub for teamwork. Extending the capabilities of Skype for Business, Teams brings together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage into a single interface, streamlining the way users get things done which, in turn, can help drive user satisfaction and accelerate business outcomes. As an existing Skype for Business customer, we invite you to upgrade to Microsoft Teams, to experience this full suite of communication and collaboration capabilities in a single client experience. 

## When should my organization upgrade to Teams?

To optimize the benefit realization of Teams, we encourage our customers to upgrade to Teams as soon as possible. We do understand that change can take time and, even if you are not ready to upgrade just yet, you can still start realizing the benefit of Teams today. Deploying Teams alongside Skype for Business allows users to become familiar with Teams now which can help facilitate the upgrade to Teams over time. In fact, many of our customers are seeing users organically shift their communication activities to Teams.  
 
## How is Microsoft helping customers with their upgrade to Teams? 

Microsoft is committed to your success and is providing robust guidance, built around a proven, end-to-end upgrade success framework to help plan and execute the upgrade to Teams. Our guidance is designed for every stage of the upgrade journey, whether you are just getting started with planning, already running Teams alongside Skype for Business or ready to upgrade to Teams.  
 
## Why do I need upgrade guidance? Canâ€™t I just delete/decommission Skype for Business? 

Upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams is more than a technical migration. It represents a transformation in how users communicate and collaborate, and change is not always easy. The ideal upgrade approach should address the technical aspects of your upgrade as well as encourage user acceptance and adoption of Teams, driving a positive user experience and business outcome realization. 

## Where do I start planning for Teams/my upgrade to Teams? 

Start your journey by familiarizing yourself with our upgrade success framework. This framework, along with the associated resources, serves as the cornerstone for navigating your journey from Skype for Business to Teams.
