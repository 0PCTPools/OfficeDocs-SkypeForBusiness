# Optimize network and media performance for Microsoft Teams

**<font color="red">LOLA: 1) Make full pass to remove SfB, repl w/Teams. 2) Incorp stuff removed from prepare-network (appended at end of this article for now).</font>**

This article describes the set of network performance requirements for Microsoft Teams. It provides in-depth guidance for assessing and optimizing your network for best Teams performance. 

If you're just starting your Teams rollout, begin by reading [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](prepare-network.md).
  
The quality of Real-Time media (audio, video, and application sharing) over IP is greatly impacted by the quality of end-to-end network connectivity. For optimal media quality in Teams, it is important for you to make sure there is a high-quality connection between your company network and Teams. The best way to accomplish this is to set up your internal network and cloud connectivity based on the capacity of your network to accommodate for peak traffic volume for Teams across all connections.
  
> [!TIP]
> If you need help optimizing your network performance, working with a Teams solution provider is a good option. To find a Teams partner, go to the [Teams solution provider portal](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home). 
  
## Network connectivity requirements for Teams

### Factors that impact Teams media quality

There are many different factors that contribute to Teams real-time media (audio, video, and application sharing) quality that include the devices that are used, the environment, and the network connectivity. 
  
#### Devices

In a media session (audio, video, or screen sharing), media capturing and rendering devices that are used by all participants such as headsets and Web cams have a great impact on the overall audio and video quality. Lower-quality devices or devices with incorrect device drivers will produce lower overall sound quality for audio and lower image quality for video. Certified devices or good quality devices, on the other hand, help with echo cancellation, noise filtering, video resolution and reduce latency.
  
Although certified audio and video media devices aren't required, we recommend that you use devices certified for Teams for an optimal media experience. To get the latest and up-to-date information on Teams certified devices, go to the [Teams Marketplace](https://office.com/teamsdevices).

You can use the [Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)](turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard.md), found in the Teams admin center, to verify devices in use are working correctly and monitor audio and video media quality.

#### Network

The quality of the Real-Time media over IP network is greatly impacted by the quality of the network connectivity, but especially by the amount of:
  
- **Latency** This is the time it takes to get an IP packet from point A to point B on the network. This network propagation delay is essentially tied to physical distance between the two points and the speed of light, including additional overhead taken by the various routers in between. Latency is measured as one-way or Round-trip Time (RTT).
    
- **Packet Loss** This is often defined as a percentage of packets that are lost in a given window of time. Packet loss directly affects audio quality—from small, individual lost packets having almost no impact, to back-to-back burst losses that cause complete audio cut-out.
    
- **Inter-packet arrival jitter or simply jitter** This is the average change in delay between successive packets. Most modern VoIP software including Skype for Business can adapt to some levels of jitter through buffering. It's only when the jitter exceeds the buffering that a participant will notice the effects of jitter.
    
> [!NOTE]
>  Buffering for jitter will increase end-to-end latency.
  
With many concurrent Skype for Business Online Real-Time media sessions, as well as other network traffic generated by other Office 365 services and other business applications, making sure that there is sufficient bandwidth over the entire network path that connects your network to the Skype for Business Online service is critical to avoid network congestion and ensure excellent media Real-Time media (audio, video, and application sharing) quality. 
  
#### Implementing Quality of Service (QoS) across congested networks

In addition, traffic congestion across a network will greatly impact media quality. To allow audio and video packets to travel the network quicker and to be prioritized over other network traffic in a congested network, Quality of Service (QoS) can be used to help provide an optimal end-user experience for audio and video communications.
  
QoS provides a way for you to assign higher priorities to network packets that are carrying audio or video data. By assigning a higher priority to these packets, audio and video communications are likely to travel over the network faster, and with less interruption, than network sessions involving things like file transfers, web browsing, or database backups. That's because the network packets used for file transfers or database backups by default are assigned "best effort" as a priority and network congestion won't have as large impact. If you don't assign a higher priority to the media (audio, video, and application sharing) packets and leave them also assigned as "best effort", they too will be processed along with all other network traffic. Depending on the amount of network congestion, this will potentially end up in a lower overall audio and video quality experience for your users.
  
It is highly recommended that you implement QoS on your network to make sure that network congestion within your network won't have an impact. However, for this to have the maximum impact, all networking endpoints must support QoS, meaning that all endpoints must honor QoS marking and packet prioritization. Skype for Business Online services honor QoS marking and prioritization within the Microsoft network. However, traffic that is routed across a public connection like the Internet from your company network to the Microsoft network doesn't preserve QoS markings and packet prioritization. Private connections from your network to Office 365 using [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/) offer a deployment solution that preserves QoS markings and packet prioritization that will in turn increase overall audio and video quality for your end users.
  
## Network performance requirements to connect to Skype for Business Online
<a name="bkNetworkPerf"> </a>

Skype for Business Real-Time media travels through many different devices, client apps, server software, and across different networks. The end-to-end latency of Real-Time media is the total amount of latency that is introduced across all components and network segments. The quality of the end-to-end network connection is determined by the network segment with the worst quality. This segment acts as a bottleneck for this network traffic.
  
The following diagram illustrates one-way audio flow in a conference from one Skype for Business participant to another.
  
![ExpressRoute Call Flow.](../images/c026e8e5-ba09-42c0-9e03-60fbfda1cb02.png)
  
In this conferencing scenario, the media path consists across the following network segments:
  
1. **Connection from User 1 to the edge of the Microsoft network** This usually includes a network connection such as WiFi or Ethernet, the WAN connection from User 1 to the Internet egress point (your network Edge device), and the Internet connection from your network Edge to Microsoft network Edge.
    
2. **Connection within Microsoft network** This is between the Microsoft Edge to Skype for Business Online data center, where the A/V Conferencing servers are used.
    
3. **Connection within Microsoft Network** This is between the Skype for Business Online data center and Microsoft network Edge.
    
4. **Connection from Microsoft network edge to User 2** This includes the Internet connection from your network Edge to Microsoft network Edge, the WAN connection from User 2 to the Internet egress point (your network Edge), and the network connection such as a WiFi or an Ethernet.
    
The following diagram shows breakdown of components and network segments of a Skype for Business Online PSTN call:
  
![ExpressRoute PSTN Carrier Call Flow.](../images/768a88df-c8a9-4171-a158-565a698f0193.png)
  
In a PSTN call scenario, the media path crosses the following network segments:
  
1. **Connection from a Skype for Business client caller to the edge of the Microsoft Network** This usually includes a network connection such as WiFi or Ethernet, the WAN connection from the Skype for Business client caller to the Internet egress point (your network Edge device), and the Internet connection from your network Edge to Microsoft network Edge.
    
2. **Connection within Microsoft network** This is between the Microsoft Edge to Skype for Business Online data center, where a Mediation Server is used.
    
3. **Connection within Microsoft Network** This is between the Skype for Business Online data center and Microsoft network Edge.
    
4. **Connection between Microsoft Network and the PSTN service provider partners** This is the connection that exists to place a PSTN call from the Skype for Business client that is outside of the Microsoft network.
    
### Network Performance requirements from a Skype for Business client to Microsoft network Edge
<a name="bkSfBClienttoEdge"></a>

For optimal Skype for Business media quality, the following network performance metrics targets or thresholds are required for a connection from your company's network to the Microsoft network Edge. This segment of the network includes your internal network, this includes all WiFi and Ethernet connections, any company site-to-site traffic over a WAN connection, for example Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), as well as the Internet or ExpressRoute partner connections to the Microsoft network Edge.
  
> [!CAUTION]
> **Connectivity between a Skype for Business client on your company network to Office 365 services must meet these following network performance requirements and thresholds.**
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Metric** <br/> |**Target** <br/> |
|Latency (one way)  <br/> |< 50ms  <br/> |
|Latency (RTT or Round-trip Time)  <br/> |< 100ms  <br/> |
|Burst packet loss  <br/> |<10% during any 200ms interval  <br/> |
|Packet loss  <br/> |<1% during any 15s interval  <br/> |
|Packet inter-arrival Jitter  <br/> |<30ms during any 15s interval  <br/> |
|Packet reorder  <br/> |<0.05% out-of-order packets  <br/> |
   
 **Other performance target requirements:**
  
- The Microsoft network has over 160 Edge locations worldwide. We work with major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) worldwide through those Edge sites. The latency metric target assumes your company site or sites and the Microsoft Edges are on the same continent.
    
- Your company site or sites to the Microsoft network Edge connection include first hop network access, which can be WiFi or another wireless technology. 
    
- The network performance target assumes proper bandwidth and/or quality of service planning. In other words, This applies directly to Skype for Business Real-Time media traffic when the network connection is under a peak load.
    
### Network performance requirements from your network Edge to Microsoft network Edge
<a name="bkYourNetworkEdge"> </a>

The following are the network performance targets or thresholds that are required for the connection between your network Edge and the Microsoft network Edge. This segment of the network excludes the customer's internal network or WAN, and is intended as guidance when testing your network traffic that is sent over the Internet, or through an ExpressRoute partner network and can also be used when negotiating a performance Service Level Agreement (SLA) with your ExpressRoute provider.
  
> [!CAUTION]
> **Connectivity between your company network Edge to the Microsoft network edge must meet these following network performance requirements and thresholds.**
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Metric** <br/> |**Target** <br/> |
|Latency (one way)  <br/> |< 30ms  <br/> |
|Latency (RTT)  <br/> |< 60ms  <br/> |
|Burst packet loss  <br/> |<1% during any 200 ms interval  <br/> |
|Packet loss  <br/> |<0.1% during any 15s interval  <br/> |
|Packet inter-arrival Jitter  <br/> |<15ms during any 15s interval  <br/> |
|Packet reorder  <br/> |<0.01% out-of-order packets  <br/> |
   
 **Other performance target requirements:**
  
- The performance target requires connection between any of your company's network Edge and its nearest Microsoft network Edge, to be on the same continent.
    
- The network performance target assumes proper bandwidth and/or quality of service planning. This also applies to Skype for Business Real-Time media traffic when the network connection is under a peak load. For proper bandwidth and QoS planning, please refer to [ExpressRoute and QoS in Skype for Business Online](https://support.office.com/article/ExpressRoute-and-QoS-in-Skype-for-Business-Online-20c654da-30ee-4e4f-a764-8b7d8844431d).
    
## Measuring network performance
<a name="bkNetworkPerf"> </a>

To measure the actual network performance, especially for latency and packet loss, from any company network site to a network Edge, you can use tools such as ping, test against a set of Skype for Business media relay services running from the Microsoft Edge and data center sites. 

>[!NOTE]
> Measuring network performance through ping (ICMP) is not effective. For that reason, the anycast IP expose below will stop answering to ICMP requests starting in Jan, 2020. To measure network performace effectively, Microsoft recommends the [Network Assesment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53885).
  
For testing Internet connections to the Microsoft network, it is recommended that you test against the following VIPs of the Skype for Business media relays. The *Anycast VIP*  will resolve to an IP address of a Media Relay in a Microsoft network Edge site that is closest to the testing location.
  
||||
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**IP address** <br/> |**Type** <br/> |**Location** <br/> |
|13.107.8.2  <br/> |VIP  <br/> |World Wide Anycast IP  <br/> |
   
 **Here are some high level recommendations to follow for assessing network performance:**
  
- You should assess your internal network as well as the connections to Office 365.
    
- You should assess and gather data for all of your networks over a long period of time. We recommend for you to perform your testing of network performance for a minimum of a week, so that you can see usage patterns for all business days and hours. This will show you peak times.
    
- You should take multiple samples of network performance measurements. We recommend taking a measurement every 10 minutes from a company site during the entire period of time you are gathering data. For comparing the Skype for Business Online network performance requirements, take the 90th percentile measurement value from this sample data set. 
    
- You should continuously assess the network's performance. Network utilization varies over time due to usage pattern changes, new enterprise-based applications that use a large amount of bandwidth, and changes to your organizational or physical company locations. It is important for you to continuously monitor your network performance against these network performance requirements and targets/thresholds and make timely adjustments to ensure the most optimal Real-Time media quality. 
    
## Measuring Network Performance using Azure VMs
<a name="bkNetworkPerf"> </a>

Instead of testing against the Microsoft network Edge sites, there are network assessment solutions from Skype for Business customers and partners that leverage testing setup for services in the Microsoft Azure cloud. In those solutions, the network assessment tools test latency, packet loss and jitter against custom endpoints set up as a service in the Azure cloud. As a result, the test network traffic travels through one additional network segment, which is the connection within the Microsoft network between the network edges and Azure data centers that hosts the network assessment service.
  
For those network assessment solutions based on Azure hosted testing services. We recommend performing the network assessment within country and/or region. For example, for customer sites in east U.S., the assessment should be performed against a testing service instance hosted in Azure's east US data center region. 
  
Below are the latency (RTT) targets for the Azure service based network assessment setup. The one-way latency targets will be half of the corresponding RTT targets. The packet loss and jitter goals stays the same as those defined for Skype Media Relay based testing.

## Media quality and ExpressRoute
<a name="bkNetworkPerf"> </a>

Azure ExpressRoute for Office 365 is a dedicated network connection for connecting to Office 365. It offers customers the ability to have control over the path their Office 365 network traffic takes. They no longer have to be concerned with the unpredictable routing that happens on the Internet where data is carried by unknown carriers, providers and ISPs. Network traffic that is sent through ExpressRoute is sent directly across the ExpressRoute partner's network to Microsoft's network. This allows customers to treat Office 365 as if it is located in their own off-site data center with a dedicated connection.
  
Azure ExpressRoute is available for all Office 365 licensing offerings. However, the Azure ExpressRoute Premium Add-on is required for Office 365 to enable global routing. Office 365 customers with at least 500 seats who are implementing ExpressRoute can get the required *ExpressRoute Premium Add-on* at no additional expense.
  
### Is ExpressRoute required for good media quality?

Azure ExpressRoute isn't a requirement for getting the most optimal Skype for Business Online media quality. It is, however, one of the deployment options that help you make sure that your cloud connectivity meets the Skype for Business network performance targets or thresholds.
  
Office 365 is a high performance and secure service that uses the Internet. We continue to invest in new security capabilities and regional Edge nodes to continuously improve security and performance. Azure ExpressRoute isn't a requirement for Office 365 services including Skype for Business Online. Azure ExpressRoute is one of the deployment options that are available that will help make sure that connectivity to Office 365 meets the Skype for Business network performance requirements and ensures the most optimal Skype for Business Online media quality experience.
  
For Skype for Business Online media quality, it is important that the connection between your company sites and the Microsoft network Edges meets the performance targets in [Network Performance requirements from a Skype for Business client to Microsoft network Edge](media-quality-and-network-connectivity-performance.md#bkSfBClienttoEdge) and that the connection between your network Edges and the Microsoft network edges meets the performance targets in [Network performance requirements from your network Edge to Microsoft network Edge](media-quality-and-network-connectivity-performance.md#bkYourNetworkEdge).  
  
It is also important that your company's physical network connectivity, including your internal network and cloud connectivity capacity accommodate peak media traffic volume. Azure ExpressRoute is one of many ways that will help customers ensure their Skype for Business Online cloud connectivity meets all of these performance requirements.
  
### Is ExpressRoute required for voice quality SLA?

No, ExpressRoute isn't required for Skype for Business Online Voice Quality SLA. The [Skype for Business Online Voice Quality SLA](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&amp;DocumentTypeId=37) applies to any eligible call placed by any Skype for Business Online voice service user within the correct license and subscription that enables that user to make any type of VoIP or PSTN call. A voice quality SLA should include that all of the following conditions are addressed:
  
- Calls from Microsoft certified IP Phones.
    
- Wired Ethernet connections.
    
- Voice quality issues due to Microsoft Network problems.
    
> [!NOTE]
> The voice quality SLA excludes those calls where the low call quality is caused by problems in non-Microsoft networks including ExpressRoute partner and other networks. 
  
### Internet or Azure ExpressRoute?

Before making a decision on network connectivity options to Skype for Business Online, customers must assess their network and current Internet connectivity based on the network performance requirements described in [Network performance requirements to connect to Skype for Business Online](media-quality-and-network-connectivity-performance.md#bkNetworkPerf).
  
If network performance over the current Internet connection is set up for enough capacity during peak time and that it meets the network performance requirements from sites to Microsoft network Edges and from your network Edges to Microsoft network Edges, you can continue to use your existing Internet connectivity to connect to Skype for Business Online.
  
For company sites where network performance requirements aren't being met, we strongly recommend that you first work with your existing network service providers to improve your overall network performance. However, if they aren't still being met, using Azure ExpressRoute can help ensure your Skype for Business Online cloud connectivity can help you meet the network performance requirements.
  
Azure ExpressRoute offers the following additional benefits:
  
- A service level agreement (SLA) on availability of the connection between your network and Microsoft network. ExpressRoute has a guaranteed Availability SLA of 99.9%.
    
- Planned and guaranteed bandwidth required for Office 365 services. You can achieve this by sending only Office 365 traffic or Skype for Business traffic using the ExpressRoute and then have all other Internet traffic go through other Internet egress/ingress points for your network.
    
- ExpressRoute is designed to preserve DSCP QoS markings between your network and the Microsoft Network.
    
For more information about ExpressRoute QoS and capacity planning, please refer to [ExpressRoute and QoS in Skype for Business Online](https://support.office.com/article/ExpressRoute-and-QoS-in-Skype-for-Business-Online-20c654da-30ee-4e4f-a764-8b7d8844431d).
  
### Can I setup Azure ExpressRoute for Skype for Business Online Only?

Yes, you can set up Azure ExpressRoute to ensure excellent network connectivity from your company's network to only Skype for Business Online. This will provide the most optimal Real-Time media quality for your users but you can then continue connecting to other Office 365 services over the Internet.
  
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a routing protocol on the Internet that is used to route network traffic across the Internet. It is designed to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS) found across the Internet. BGP communities values are attribute tags that can be applied to incoming or outgoing routes. BGP communities are often used to signal to the receiving AS which outbound link to use to reach a given destination based on geography, service type or other criteria.
  
With BGP communities support, Microsoft will tag prefixes and routes with appropriate BGP community values based on the service they belong to. Microsoft will tag prefixes advertised through public peering and Microsoft peering with appropriate BGP community values indicating the region the prefixes are hosted in. You can rely on the community values to make appropriate routing decisions to offer optimal routing. You can use the Skype for Business Online BGP community value to setup up an ExpressRoute connection only for Skype for Business Online. You can find out more at [ExpressRoute routing requirements](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/expressroute-routing/).
  
## ExpressRoute connectivity scenarios for Skype for Business Online
<a name="bkNetworkPerf"> </a>

If you have decided that ExpressRoute based on recommendations above is for you, here are the recommendations on where and how many ExpressRoute connections you should get.
  
### Online only deployment - Single site

If all of your users use the Skype for Business Online service, and if your offices are centered around a single physical location and you decide to deploy Azure ExpressRoute, you should set up single ExpressRoute connection between your company site to the closest [ExpressRoute peering location](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/expressroute-locations/).
  
The following graphic shows an example of this type of deployment. For this example, Contoso is a university located in Orlando, FL. Contoso has 10,000 faculty members and students. The Internet tests from their location to Microsoft edge sites showed greater than 5% packet loss during peak class hours. They have decided to get a dedicated connection to Office 365 using ExpressRoute with over-provisioned bandwidth so they can avoid the network congestion for Office 365 especially for Skype for Business Online Real-Time traffic. They connect to the Microsoft cloud through ExpressRoute at the Atlanta, GA MeetMe site.
  
![ExpressRoute Single Site.](../images/59fbca3c-a3ea-4568-8da5-3281096a7453.png)
  
### Online only deployment - Multiple sites on the same continent

If your company is using Skype for Business Online services from multiple offices in the same region or continent, and you chose to implement Azure ExpressRoute, it is recommended to connect your main site via ExpressRoute, and then optionally add additional ExpressRoute peering for other locations that do not meet the recommended network performance targets.
  
In the following example, Contoso is an US travel services company that is headquartered in New York but has other offices across the United States. Their offices are inter-connected through an WAN that uses MPLS for connecting to Office 365. They initially set up an ExpressRoute connection from their Internet router in Hoboken, New Jersey to the New York MeetMe site. 
  
With this setup, network traffic from most of their sites to the Microsoft Network (New York Edge site) can meet the Skype for Business client connection network performance targets described in [Network Performance requirements from a Skype for Business client to Microsoft network Edge](media-quality-and-network-connectivity-performance.md#bkSfBClienttoEdge). However, latency between Contoso's west coast offices to New York is going over 50ms one-way. In addition, Honolulu is the second largest office for Contoso, latency from Honolulu to New York exceeds 80ms one-way. To ensure good media quality for users in those offices, Contoso decided to add a west coast ExpressRoute connection between their San Jose site and the Silicon Valley ExpressRoute MeetMe site.
  
![Express Router Multi-site on the same continent.](../images/bf57a473-01e1-4271-9675-385767bc58e1.png)
  
### Online only deployment - Multiple sites on different continents

If all of your users are using Skype for Business Online service, and if your offices are in multiple physical locations across multiple continents, if you decide to deploy Azure ExpressRoute, you should set up at least one ExpressRoute connection for each continent between each continent's main site to its closest [ExpressRoute peering location](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/expressroute-locations/). Depending on cost vs benefit, you can choose to deploy additional ExpressRoute connections from sites where network performance targets aren't met.
  
In the following example, Contoso is a large corporate law firm with offices in major cities across North America and Europe. Based on their Internet connection and their internal network performance assessment, Contoso decided to deploy two ExpressRoute connections in North America and a single ExpressRoute circuit for all their European offices.
  
![ExpressRoute with multiple sites and continents.](../images/c967550b-dc85-4b37-a7bc-cd825ec86854.png)
  
### Hybrid deployment

If you have an on-premises Lync or Skype for Business deployment and choose to implement a hybrid Skype for Business Online integration, we recommend that if you decide to deploy Azure ExpressRoute, you need to have at least one ExpressRoute connection for each on-premises Lync or Skype for Business Edge site and at least one ExpressRoute connection for each continent with offices. Depending on cost vs benefit, for each continent you can choose to deploy additional ExpressRoute connections from offices where network performance targets aren't being met.
  
If you have an on-premises Skype for Business deployment, you must follow the [Edge Server Planning and Deployment Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt346417.aspx). Specifically, the Edge servers must be reachable from outside of your network. This is usually achieved either by assigning a routable public IP address to the Edge server, or by using network address translation (NAT).
  
In the following example, Contoso has an existing on-premises Skype for Business Enterprise Voice deployment. They want to migrate on-premises users to Office 365 online services. They also decided to use a hybrid deployment so that they can continue to use their existing PSTN infrastructure for all on-premises and online users. Contoso's on-premises data center and Skype for Business Edge Servers are in Chicago. For their deployment, Contoso decided to set up one ExpressRoute connection between their Chicago data center and the Chicago ExpressRoute. They also added a west coast ExpressRoute connection to better serve their Honolulu office.
  
![ExpressRoute Hybrid.](../images/a7467c56-642f-44e5-adfb-ecca91ba2dd3.png)
  
### Online deployment with Cloud Connector Edition

Skype for Business Online Cloud Connector Edition is a hybrid offering that consists of a set of packaged Virtual Machines (VMs) that implement on-premises PSTN connectivity. By deploying a minimal Skype for Business Server topology in a virtualized environment, you will be able to send and receive calls with landlines and mobile phones through the existing on-premises PSTN voice infrastructure.
  
If you decide to deploy Azure ExpressRoute and Cloud Connector Edition, we recommend for you to set up at least one Express Route connection for each continent between each continent's main site to it's closest [ExpressRoute peering location](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/expressroute-locations/). Depending on cost vs benefit, for each continent you can choose to deploy additional ExpressRoute connections from sites where network performance targets aren't being met.
  
If you have an on-premises Skype for Business deployment, you must follow the [Planning Guide for Skype for Business Cloud Connector Edition](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt605227.aspx). Specifically, the Access Edge and A/V Edge services should be assigned public IP addresses and reachable from Office 365 data centers.
  
In the following example, Contoso is a European accounting firm with presence in a few major European countries and cities. When they sign up for Skype for Business Online for all their collaboration needs, they decided to put a Cloud Connector for each country they have a physical location to continue to use their PSTN infrastructure and carrier contracts that already exist. Based on their testing from all their sites and Microsoft network Edge, they determined that a single ExpressRoute connection in London will help meet the Skype for Business client connection network performance targets described in [Network Performance requirements from a Skype for Business client to Microsoft network Edge](media-quality-and-network-connectivity-performance.md#bkSfBClienttoEdge).

## Test the network

After you're done optimizing your network, test it to see if your optimizations worked. Did your changes give you the network-performance improvements you were looking for?

Best practice: Take baseline readings once in a while, when your network is working well. This gives you something to compare against when you're having problems. Similarly, if you do a major update to your network, take another baseline.

Download the [Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53885) to test whether your network is ready for Teams. This tool tests whether all the correct ports are open, and it can identify network impairments.

After you download and install the tool, you'll find it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool. A detailed guide for how to use the tool, Usage.docx, is included in that directory.

### Test for opened ports

To test for opened ports, open a Command prompt window and navigate to the Network Assessment Tool directory by entering **cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool**. At the command prompt, start the test for opened ports by entering **networkassessmenttool.exe /connectivitycheck**.

After running the checks, the tool will either display the message “Verifications Completed Successfully” or report on the ports that were blocked. It also generates a file named Connectivity_results.txt, which contains the output from the tool and stores it in the %userprofile%\\appdata\\local\\microsoft skype for business network assessment tool\\ directory.

Best practice: Run the connectivity checks on a regular basis to ensure that ports are open and functioning correctly.

### Test for network impairments

Network impairments affect Teams performance, so you'll want to find and remediate them. The most common network impairments are delay (latency), packet loss, and jitter.

- **Latency:** This is the time it takes to get an IP packet from point A to point B on the network. This network propagation delay is essentially tied to physical distance between the two points and the speed of light, including additional overhead taken by the various routers in between. Latency is measured as one-way or round-trip time.

- **Packet loss**: This is often defined as a percentage of packets that are lost in a given window of time. Packet loss directly affects audio quality—from small, individual lost packets having almost no impact to back-to-back burst losses that cause audio to cut out completely.

- **Inter-packet arrival jitter, or simply jitter:** This is the average change in delay between successive packets. Most modern VoIP software, including Skype for Business, can adapt to some levels of jitter through buffering. It's only when the jitter exceeds the buffering that a participant will notice the effects of jitter.

The maximum values for these impairments are described in [Media quality and network connectivity performance](/SkypeForBusiness/optimizing-your-network/media-quality-and-network-connectivity-performance). When testing for these impairments, we distinguish between two separate segments:

- The *edge segment* is the segment in which your router lives. This is the closest logical network segment connected to the internet at each of your locations. In most cases, this is the connection point of the router, or possibly a perimeter network (also known as *DMZ*, *demilitarized zone*, and *screened subnet*). No further traffic that affects devices other than the router should occur between this segment and the internet.

- The *client segment* is the logical network segment in which your clients reside.

You should test both segments by using the Network Assessment Tool. To test the segment, navigate to the directory and enter **networkassessmenttool.exe** at the command prompt. The results are written to a file named Results.tsv, and you can compare them to the [requirements](/SkypeForBusiness/optimizing-your-network/media-quality-and-network-connectivity-performance) for each segment.

For best Teams performance, both segments should meet the requirements. Best practice: Run the tool multiple times for one hour straight to get a good indication of your network’s performance.

## How network traffic flows in Teams

Teams combines three forms of traffic:

-   Data traffic between the Office 365 online environment and the Teams client (signaling, presence, chat, file upload and download, OneNote synchronization).
-   Peer-to-peer real-time communications traffic (audio, video, desktop sharing).
-   Conferencing real-time communications traffic (audio, video, desktop sharing).

This impacts the network on two levels: traffic will flow between the Microsoft Teams clients directly for peer-to-peer scenarios, and traffic will flow between the Office 365 environment and the Microsoft Teams clients for meeting scenarios. To ensure optimal traffic flow, traffic must be allowed to flow both between the internal network segments (for example, between sites over the WAN) as well as between the network sites and Office 365. Not opening the correct ports or actively blocking specific ports will lead to a degraded experience.

For the two defining network segments (Client to Microsoft Edge and Customer Edge to Microsoft Edge), consider the following recommendations.

|Value  |Client to Microsoft Edge  |Customer Edge to Microsoft Edge  |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
|**Latency (one way)** \*  |< 50ms          |< 30ms         |
|**Latency (RTT or Round-trip Time)** \* |< 100ms   |< 60ms |
|**Burst packet loss**    |<10% during any 200ms interval         |<1% during any 200ms interval         |
|**Packet loss**     |<1% during any 15s interval          |<0.1% during any 15s interval         |
|**Packet inter-arrival Jitter**    |<30ms during any 15s interval         |<15ms during any 15s interval         |
|**Packet reorder**    |<0.05% out-of-order packets         |<0.01% out-of-order packets         |

\* The latency metric targets assume your company site or sites and the Microsoft edges are on the same continent.

Your company site connection to the Microsoft network edge includes first hop network access, which can be WiFi or another wireless technology.

The network performance targets assume proper bandwidth and/or [QoS planning](QoS-in-Teams.md). In other words, the requirements apply directly to Teams real-time media traffic when the network connection is under a peak load.

## Bandwidth requirements
Microsoft Teams gives you the best audio, video and content sharing experience regardless of your network conditions. With variable codecs, media can be negotiated in limited bandwidth environments with minimal impact. But where bandwidth is not a concern, experiences can be optimized for quality, including up to 1080p video resolution, up to 30fps for video and 15fps for content, and high-fidelity audio.

[!INCLUDE [Bandwidth requirements](includes/bandwidth-requirements.md)]

**<font color="red">REVIEWERS: The following information was commented out of the article. It's in more depth than the bandwidth-requirements article included above. Keep or kill?</font>**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>If the required bandwidth is not available, the media stack inside Teams will degrade the quality of the audio/video session to accommodate for that lower amount of available bandwidth, impacting the quality of the call/meeting. The Teams client will attempt to prioritize the quality of audio over the quality of video. It is therefore extremely important to have the expected bandwidth available.

## Firewall and proxy requirements

TCP ports 80 and 443 are used to connect to web-based content such as SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and Teams Chat services. Plug-ins and connectors also connect over these TCP ports. The four UDP ports (3478 through 3481) are used for media such as audio and video, to ensure they flow correctly.

If your organization requires that you specify the exact IP address ranges and domains to which these ports should be opened, you can restrict the target IP ranges and domains for these ports. For a list of exact ports, protocols, and IP ranges, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges). If you choose to restrict the target IP address ranges and domains, you must ensure that you keep the list of ports and ranges up to date because they might change. It’s also a good practice to test whether all ports are opened by running the [Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53885) on a regular basis. 

If you use one, we recommend that you bypass the proxy server for all Teams services. Although using a proxy might work, it’s likely that quality will be reduced due to media using TCP instead of UDP. For more information about proxy servers and bypassing them, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](office-365-urls-ip-address-ranges.md).
