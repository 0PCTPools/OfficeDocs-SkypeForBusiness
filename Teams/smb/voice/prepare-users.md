# How do I prepare my users for Business Voice?

## Devices for Business Voice

Users you license for Business Voice need a microphone and speakers to make or receive phone calls. There are lots of options depending on the needs of each user or environment. Here are some ideas to think about when deciding what to get:

* **Mobile users or those in noisy environments** - USB headsets with microphones. Paired with Microsoft Teams, a computer can be turned into a phone as long as it has an Internet connection.
* **Receptionists and executives** - Full, multi-function, desktop handsets can be used just like regular phones; auto-dial, conferencing, speakerphone, and support for headsets, make these extremely flexible.
* **Conference rooms** - Audio conferencing devices let you set up entire conference rooms with speakerphone abilities that can be used with Teams conference bridges to host large meetings.

To see all the devices that are supported with Teams, take a look in the [Office Devices store](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices).
