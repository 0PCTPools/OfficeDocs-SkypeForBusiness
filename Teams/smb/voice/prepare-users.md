# How do I get my users ready for Business Voice?

It's a good idea to get your users ready before you set up Business Voice. Make sure they have Microsoft Teams installed, set up devices on their computers, show them how to set up voicemail greetings and other Business Voice features, and encourage them to learn more about Teams so they get the most out of it.

## Install Microsoft Teams on computers and phones

If you haven't already, you need to install Teams on any computer and phone that users want to use to make calls over Business Voice. Teams is available for PCs and Macs, and for Android and iPhone phones. It's even on the web at https://teams.microsoft.com! All of these options support Business Voice. For PCs, Macs, and the web, you'll need to add a headset or other device that has a microphone and speakers. The next section has more information on that.

For PCs and Macs, you can download Teams at https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads. If a user is running Windows 10 in S mode, they can install Teams from the Windows Store.
For Android and iPhone phones, you can install the app by searching for Microsoft Teams in Google Play and the Apple App Store. Keep in mind that phones need to be running Android 4.4 or later, or iOS 10.0 or later.
To use Teams on the web, you need to use a supported browser. For a list of supported browser, take a look at the [Web client section in Get clients for Microsoft Teams](../../get-clients.md#web-client).

## Devices for Microsoft Teams

Users you license for Business Voice need a microphone and speakers to make or receive phone calls. There are lots of options depending on the needs of each user or environment. Here are some ideas to think about when deciding what to get:

* **Mobile users or those in noisy environments** - USB and wireless headsets with microphones. Paired with Microsoft Teams, a computer can be turned into a phone as long as it has an Internet connection.
* **Receptionists and executives** - Full, multi-function, desktop handsets can be used just like regular phones; auto-dial, conferencing, speakerphone, and support for headsets, make these extremely flexible.
* **Conference rooms** - Audio conferencing devices let you set up entire conference rooms with speakerphone abilities that can be used with Teams conference bridges to host large meetings.

If you're using a USB or wireless device, plug the device into a computer running Teams. You might need to go into device settings in Teams (click on your profile picture at the top of Teams, select **Settings**, and then **Devices**) and choose your device from **Audio devices**. For other devices, follow the instructions to set it up for use with Teams.

To see all the devices that are supported with Teams, take a look in the [Office Devices store](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices).

## Set up voicemail greetings and other Business Voice features

Just like regular phones, you can set up voicemail greetings, call forwarding, choose ringtones, and more. Everything that can be set up by users can be found in the Teams app under **Settings**. They can get help with setting up these features by taking a look at [Manage your call settings in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/manage-your-call-settings-in-teams-456cb611-3477-496f-b31a-6ab752a7595f).

## Learn what Microsoft Teams and Business Voice can do

Business Voice can do a lot more than regular phones, too. You can set up simultaneous ring and call groups, share a phone line with a delegate, park calls, make multiple calls at once, and more. Users can see what Teams with Business Voice can do, and learn how to set it up, by taking a look at [Meetings and calls](https://support.office.com/article/meetings-and-calls-d92432d5-dd0f-4d17-8f69-06096b6b48a8?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#ID0EAABAAA=Calls).

If users want to know even more about Teams, they can take a look the [Microsoft Teams help center](https://support.office.com/teams).
