# What do I need to purchase to use Business Voice?

## Maximum number of supported users

The Business Voice add-on that's available with small and medium-sized Microsoft 365 subscriptions supports up to a maximum of 300 licensed users. If you want to license more than 300 users for Business Voice, you need to purchase a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 subscription.

## Getting the right license

If someone in your organization wants to make or receive phone calls to or from an external phone number, they need a Business Voice license. A Business Voice license gives them all the features they need to make or receive phone calls, host audio conferences, and more. Users who don't need to make or receive phone calls to or from external phone calls just need Teams; they don't need a Business Voice license. For example, you might have 10 factory employees and 5 office employees. The factory employees only need to call other employees within your company. The office employees need to call other employees, and they also need to make and receive phone calls to and from suppliers, partners, and customers. In this case, only the 5 office workers would need a Business Voice license.

## International and toll-free calls

While Business Voice includes domestic calling plans, you need to purchase communications credits to make international calls. Communication credits are an easy way for you to pay for long distance calls. When you buy communications credits, they're stored in your account until someone needs to make an international phone call. The cost of the international phone call is deducted from your communications credit balance at the end of the call. You can choose to do a one-time purchase of communications credits to add a balance to your account, or you can set up **auto-recharge**. With auto-recharge, your communications credit balance is topped-up when its minimum balance falls below an amount you specify. We recommend setting up an auto-recharge amount so you don't have to worry about periodically purchasing communications credits.

You can also buy toll-free numbers with Business Voice. Toll-free numbers have a one-time charge to purchase the number and then a per-minute rate for calls to the number. Like international calls, calls to toll-free numbers consume communications credits. If you purchase a toll-free number, you'll need to make sure you have enough communications credits to cover toll-free charges.
