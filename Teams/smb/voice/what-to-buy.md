# What do I need to purchase to use Business Voice?

## Maximum number of supported users

The Business Voice add-on that's available with small and medium-sized Microsoft 365 subscriptions supports up to a maximum of 300 licensed users. If you want to license more than 300 users for Business Voice, you need to purchase a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 subscription.

## Getting the right license

If someone in your organization wants to make or receive phone calls to or from an external phone number, they need a Business Voice license. A Business Voice license gives them all the features they need to make or receive phone calls, host audio conferences, and more. Users who don't need to make or receive phone calls to or from external phone calls just need Teams; they don't need a Business Voice license. For example, you might have 10 factory employees and 5 office employees. The factory employees only need to call other employees within your company. The office employees need to call other employees, and they also need to make and receive phone calls to and from suppliers, partners, and customers. In this case, only the 5 office workers would need a Business Voice license.

## Communications credits

Communications credits are used to pay for calls made to phone numbers outside your phone system. For example, if you call a domestic supplier, if you call your cell phone from an audio conference, or if you call an international number, you need Communication Credits. Communication Credits are also used if you purchased a toll-free number. When someone calls your toll-free number, Communication Credits are used to pay for the time they use.

When you buy Business Voice, your organization gets a monthly allotment of Communication Credits that can be used for domestic calls. Here's how much you get each month:

|Where your organization's located  |Monthly allotment for domestic calls |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Canada                             | 3000                                |
|United Kingdom                     | 1200                                |
|United States                      | 3000                                |

If you still have Communication Credits left over at the end of the month (either from your monthly allotment or from Communications Credits you buy), they're carried over to the next month.

### Buy Communication Credits

If you use up your monthly allotment of Communication Credits, or if you want to make international calls, you can buy more. We strongly recommend that you always keep a minimum amount of Communication Credits so that your users can always make phone calls. The easiest way to make sure you always have enough credits is to set up automatic recharging. With automatic recharging, if your Communication Credits balance goes below a minimum limit, Microsoft 365 will automatically purchase more for you. You can choose the minimum limit and the number of Communication Credits to buy each time. If you'd rather buy Communication Credits manually, you can do that too.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember that you need Communications Credits to call phone numbers outside your organization. If you run out of Communications Credits, you won't be able to make domestic or international phone calls, and you won't be able to receive phone calls on toll-free phone numbers.
