# Use the Getting Started wizard to set up Business Voice

The Getting Started wizard for Microsoft 365 Business Voice gives you and easy and quick way to start receiving and making phone calls in Microsoft Teams. If you're a small business just starting out, the wizard can get you up and running in a few minutes with phone numbers, extensions, greetings, and more. If you're a larger business with an established telephony solution, the wizard can help you set up a Business Voice pilot so you can try it out before moving to Microsoft 365.

The Getting Started wizard helps you set up the following features and tasks for Business Voice:

* **Emergency services location** - This location is given to emergency services providers when you call an emergency phone number, such as 911, 999, and so on.
* **Company phone number** - The main phone number customers and others call to reach your business.
* **Assigning licenses to users** - You can select with users you want to assign a Business Voice and phone number to.
* **Incoming call greeting** - The greeting callers will hear when they call your company phone number.
* **Call menu** - A menu of options callers can choose from to get forwarded to extensions for sales, customer support, and so on.

After you've finished the wizard, here are a couple articles you can check out to see what you can do with Business Voice and learn how to customize it. If you don't want to customize anything, you're done! You can start using Business Voice right away.

## Emergency services location

The emergency location is used to route calls to emergency services to the appropriate dispatch authorities and to assist in locating the emergency caller. An emergency location may be referred to as a civic address, street address, or a physical address. It is the street or civic address of a place of business for your organization.

By default, the address that was provided when you signed up for Microsoft 365 is used for your emergency location. If you'd like to change the emergency address, click **Edit** and enter a new address. The address you provide is validated to make sure that it's legitimate and correctly formatted for emergency response services. If it's valid, the address is assigned to all of the users you assign a number to in the next step. If you have employees in more than one location, the Customize Business Voice topic will show you how to add and assign more emergency addresses after you finish the Getting Started wizard.

## Company phone number

Your company phone number is the number that customers and others call to reach your business. This is a special number because it doesn't belong to any one person. Instead, you can choose to forward it to a specific person or set up call forwarding rules to give callers options for who to contact (more on that later).

In addition to setting up a new phone local phone number, you can choose to purchase a toll-free number or port an existing number to Microsoft 365. If you choose to set up a toll-free number, you'll be charged a setup fee and will also need to purchase a calling plan. If you want to port a number to Microsoft 365, you'll have an option to do so after the wizard completes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to port an existing phone number to Microsoft 365, you'll still see a temporary phone number in the wizard. This is ok. After you complete the wizard, and you complete the porting process, the temporary phone number will be replaced with your phone number.

## Assigning licenses to users

You need to assign a Business Voice license to every person in your organization that wants to make or receive phone calls outside of Teams. For example, if a user wants to receive phone calls from external customers, or make phone calls to partners or suppliers, they need a Business Voice license. When assigning licenses, you can select up to the number of available Business Voice licenses you have available. If you don't have enough licenses, you can add more licenses after the wizard is complete.

When phone numbers are assigned to users, you can't choose which numbers the users will get. The phone numbers will be retrieved from a pool of numbers and may or may not be sequential.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to port existing phone numbers to Microsoft 365 for individual users, you can do so after the wizard is complete. After you complete the porting process, the ported phone numbers will replace the temporary phone numbers selected by the wizard.

## Incoming call greeting

You can set up a call greeting that'll be played to customers and others when they call your company phone number. The greeting can tell people your company name, business hours, or other important information.

If you already have a greeting recorded in MP3 or WAV format, and the file is under 5 megabytes (MB), you can upload the file directly to Microsoft 365. That file will be played when someone calls your company phone number. If you don't have a recording, you can type in what you want the greeting to say. When someone calls your company phone number, a text-to-speech service will read the greeting to the caller. In order to get some pronunciations correct, you might need to mis-spell the words or use phonetic spellings.

## Call menu and forwarding

You have a choice fo how to handle phone calls to the company phone number. You can forward all calls to a specific user, or you can set up a call menu they can choose options from. 

If you want to forward all calls to a specific person, just select **Forward to one person** and then select the user account that should receive the phone calls.

If you want to set up a call menu, select **Create call menu**. When you choose to create a call menu, you can specify options that a caller can select either by pressing a number on a phone's keypad, or by speaking the option. Each option is made up of a dial key, a voice command, and a user to forward the call to. If you provide a value for a voice command, Microsoft 365 will license for that command forward the call to the user in the **Forward to** field.
