# Use the Getting Started wizard to set up Business Voice

The Getting Started wizard for Microsoft 365 Business Voice gives you and easy and quick way to start receiving and making phone calls in Microsoft Teams. If you're a small business just starting out, the wizard can get you up and running in a few minutes with phone numbers, extensions, greetings, and more. If you're a larger business with an established telephony solution, the wizard can help you set up a Business Voice pilot so you can try it out before moving to Microsoft 365.
