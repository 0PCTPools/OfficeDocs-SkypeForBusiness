# Can I set up my existing phone lines with Business Voice?

Almost anyone can get set up phones with Microsoft 365 Business Voice, but whether you might need some help depends on how your phones are currently set up. Check out the following table to see whether you can set up Business Voice on your own or if you need to get help from a Microsoft partner.

| What does your phone system have?            | Self or partner setup |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Single phone line                            | Self                  |
| Individual phone lines to one or more people | Self                  |
| Internal or direct dial                      | Partner               |
| Call menus                                   | Partner               |
| Online provider                              | Partner               |

If you have a phone system that has any features listed next to "Partner" in the table above, you'll need help from a Microsoft partner. If you don't have anything that needs help from a partner, you can use the steps in these articles to get you up and running!
