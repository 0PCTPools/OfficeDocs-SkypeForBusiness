# Can I set up my existing phone system with Business Voice?

You might already have a phone system set up in your company. This is probably true if people can call a main phone number and dial an extension to get to a user. Callers might also get a call menu with options like Sales, Marketing, and so on, if you already have a phone system (often referred to as a PBX or personal branch exchange).

If you already have a phone system set up, or if you're not sure if you do, you'll need to contact a Microsoft partner. They can help you determine what you have set up and whether you need their help to connect your phone system to Business Voice. The Getting Started wizard doesn't support setting up an existing phone system with Business Voice.
