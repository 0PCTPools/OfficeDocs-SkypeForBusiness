# What to know before adding Business Voice

Thinking about setting up Microsoft 365 Business Voice? Great! This article talks about a few things you should think about before setting up Business Voice.

## Maximum number of supported users

The Business Voice add-on that's available with small and medium-sized Microsoft 365 subscriptions supports up to a maximum of 300 licensed users. If you want to license more than 300 users for Business Voice, you need to purchase a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 subscription.

## Working with a phone system you're already running

You might already have a phone system set up in your company. This is probably true if people can call a main phone number and dial an extension to get to a user. Callers might also get a call menu with options like Sales, Marketing, and so on, if you already have a phone system (often referred to as a PBX or personal branch exchange).

If you already have a phone system set up, or if you're not sure if you do, you'll need to contact a Microsoft partner. They can help you determine what you have set up and whether you need their help to connect your phone system to Business Voice. The Getting Started wizard doesn't support setting up an existing phone system with Business Voice.

## Moving phone numbers to Business Voice

You probably already have phone numbers set up so customers can reach you. That's no problem. During the Getting Started wizard, you'll be asked to pick some phone numbers to set up Business Voice. After you've finished the wizard, you can replace those phone numbers with the ones you're already using. We'll help you move (often called "porting") your phone numbers to Business Voice.

## Deciding who (and what) should get a Business Voice license

## Your Internet connection

Business Voice is located in the cloud with Microsoft 365. To get the best experience with Business Voice, you need a broadband Internet connection that can support the expected number of phone calls that will be made at any one time. Here's a table to help you make sure your Internet connection is fast enough for the number of people who will be using Business Voice. If you don't know how fast your Internet connection, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

|Concurrent users  |Activity  |Minimum recommended connection speed  |
|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
|1-10              | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|11-50             | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|51-100            | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|101-200           | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|201-300           | Calling  | **need value**                       |
