# What to know before adding Business Voice

Thinking about setting up Microsoft 365 Business Voice? Great! This article talks about a few things you should think about before setting up Business Voice.

## Moving phone numbers to Business Voice

You probably already have phone numbers set up so customers can reach you. That's no problem. During the Getting Started wizard, you'll be asked to pick some phone numbers to set up Business Voice. After you've finished the wizard, you can replace those phone numbers with the ones you're already using. We'll help you move (often called "porting") your phone numbers to Business Voice.

## Your Internet connection

Business Voice is located in the cloud with Microsoft 365. To get the best experience with Business Voice, you need a broadband Internet connection that can support the expected number of phone calls that will be made at any one time. Here's a table to help you make sure your Internet connection is fast enough for the number of people who will be using Business Voice. If you don't know how fast your Internet connection, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

|Concurrent users  |Activity  |Minimum recommended connection speed  |
|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
|1-10              | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|11-50             | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|51-100            | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|101-200           | Calling  | **need value**                       |
|201-300           | Calling  | **need value**                       |
