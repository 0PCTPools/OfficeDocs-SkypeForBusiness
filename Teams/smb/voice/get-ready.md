# How do I get my organization ready for Business Voice?

## Your Internet connection

Business Voice is located in the cloud with Microsoft 365. To get the best experience with Business Voice, you need a broadband Internet connection that can support the expected number of phone calls that will be made at any one time. Here's a table to help you make sure your Internet connection is fast enough for the number of people who will be using Business Voice. If you don't know how fast your Internet connection, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
