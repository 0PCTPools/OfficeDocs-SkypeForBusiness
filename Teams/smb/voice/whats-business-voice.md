# What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?

Microsoft 365 Business Voice makes it easy for small and medium organizations to turn Microsoft Teams into a powerful and flexible telephone system. It's a replacement for traditional telephony providers and in-house phone systems that can be difficult and costly to manage. You can set up both toll and toll-free numbers, call menus to help callers get to the right department, audio conferencing so you can host meetings with anyone, and more. You can even give people their own phone numbers so they can get calls directly.

Business Voice does all of this by wrapping up Microsoft 365 Phone System features into a single and easy-to-manage bundle. You don't need to worry about choosing the right plan or feature; they're all there and set up for you. Because Phone System is a part of Teams, you can turn any PC, Mac, or mobile device, into a phone that can use your Business Voice phone number.

Business Voice is right for you if your organization has 300 or fewer people and you're using one the following Microsoft 365 subscriptions:

* Microsoft 365 Business
* Office 365 Business Premium
* Office 365 Business Essentials
* Microsoft 365 E3
* Microsoft 365 E5
* Microsoft 365 F1

When you buy Business Voice, you get the following features and more:
