# Microsoft Teams meeting attendance report

Meeting organizers can view and download a meeting attendance report. Find this report in the **Participants** pane of the meeting, at the bottom of the pane.

For education tenants, this report is useful to track student attendance in online classes. For example, the teacher can download the attendance report at the start of class as a simple way to do a "roll call." To learn more, read [Jon Johnstone's SOC article here].

Teams admins can view additional meeting attendance data in the Teams admin center, under **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. See [Related topics](#related-topics) below to learn more.
