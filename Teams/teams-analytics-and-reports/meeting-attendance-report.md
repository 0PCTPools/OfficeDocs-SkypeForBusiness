# Microsoft Teams meeting attendance report

Meeting organizers can view and download a meeting attendance report. Find this report in the **Participants** pane of the meeting, at the bottom of the pane. You can download the report as a .CSV file (text format).

For education tenants, this report is useful to track student attendance in online classes. For example, the teacher can download the attendance report at the start of class as a simple way to do a "roll call." To learn more, read [Jon Johnstone's SOC article here].

Teams admins can view additional meeting attendance data in the Teams admin center, under **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. See [Related topics](#related-topics) below to learn more.

If meeting organizers need access to more meeting attendance data than they get from the report available within the meeting, you can assign the *Report reader* role so they can access the Teams admin reports themselves. To learn about this, read [Who can access the Teams activity reports](../teams-activity-reports.md#who-can-access-the-teams-activity-reports).
