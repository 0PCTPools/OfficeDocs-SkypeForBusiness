# Microsoft Teams analytics and reporting

A new analytics and reporting experience for Microsoft Teams is available in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center. You can run different reports to get insights into how users in your organization are using Teams. For example, you can see how many users communicate through channel and chat messages and the kinds of devices they use to connect to Teams. Your organization can use the information from the reports to better understand usage patterns, help make business decisions, and inform training and communication efforts.

## How to access the reports

To access the reports, you must be a global admin in Office 365, Teams service admin, or Skype for Business admin.  Go to the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center, in the left navigation, select **Analytics & reports**, and then under **Report**, choose the report you want to run.

> [!NOTE]
> The reports in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center are separate from the activity reports for Teams that are part of the Office 365 reports in the Office 365 admin center. For more information about the activity reports in the Office 365 admin center, see [Use activity reports for Microsoft Teams].(../teams-activity-reports.md)

## Teams reporting reference

Here's a list of the Teams reports available in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center and an overview of the information that's available in each report.

We're continually improving the Teams reporting experience and adding features and functionality. Over time, we'll be building additional capabilities into the reports and adding new reports.
