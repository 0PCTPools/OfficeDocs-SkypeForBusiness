# Microsoft Teams usage report

The Teams usage report in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center gives you an overview of the usage activity in Teams, including the number of active users and channels, so you can quickly see how many users across your organization are using Teams to communicate and collaborate. This report also gives you a view into usage in each team by showing you the number of active users and channels, guests, and messages for each team.
