# Microsoft Teams live event usage report

The Teams live event usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center shows you the activity overview for live events held in your organization. You can view usage information, including event status, start time, views, and production type for each event. You can gain insight into usage trends and see who in your organization schedules, presents, and produces live events.
