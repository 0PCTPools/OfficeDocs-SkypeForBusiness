# View cross-team and per-team analytics in Teams

In Microsoft Teams, users can view analytics for teams that they are members or owners of. This information gives users insight into usage patterns and activity on their teams. They can see data such as the number of active users, guests, and messages in each team.

Cross-team analytics gives users a broad overview of usage data for all teams that they are a member or owner of in a single list view. This includes active user and message counts and trend lines for team activity.  

Per-team analytics gives users a more granular view of usage data for a specific team. This includes temporal-based charts for active user and message counts plus deeper breakdowns of user types and activity trends.

## View analytics for all teams that you're a member or owner of

1. In Teams, at the bottom of the teams list, next to **Join or create a team**, click **Manage teams**.
2. On the **Analytics** tab, select a date range to show usage data for all teams that you're a member or owner of.
