# Cloud voice in Teams

This is a new topic. It should guide the admin through deploying cloud voice workloads. It assumes they've already set up Teams and created their first teams & channels. It assumes people have started to use chat. They should probably have already deployed meetings (necessary?) This is part of the "story line" of deploying the 4 main Teams workloads.
