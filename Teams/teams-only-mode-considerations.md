# Teams Only mode considerations



> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE [upgrade-disclaimer](includes/upgrade-disclaimer.md)]

While thousands of customers have successfully upgraded to Microsoft Teams, there are a few considerations that may influence your organization’s upgrade timeline and user experience. Prior to upgrading users to Teams Only mode, review the below scenarios for applicability and take the recommended next actions to help ensure a positive upgrade to Teams. 

**Tenant-wide considerations**: we are working on enabling Teams in the following environment; however, in the meantime administrators shouldn’t upgrade any users in their organization if either of the following is true:

- The Skype for Business tenant is hosted in one of the following environments:
    - Government Community Cloud High
    - Government Community Cloud DoD
    - Office 365 operated by 21Vianet
    - Office 365 Germany

- The Skype for Business tenant is hosted in France or South Korea AND Teams residency is required in the region.
