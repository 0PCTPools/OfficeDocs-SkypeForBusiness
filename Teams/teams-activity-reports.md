Use activity reports for Microsoft Teams 
========================================

You can use activity reports to see how users in your organization are using Microsoft Teams. For example, if some donâ€™t use Teams yet, they might not know how to get started or understand how they can use Teams to be more productive and collaborative. Your organization can use the activity reports to decide where to prioritize training and communication efforts.

Reports are available for the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days. Data won't exist for all reporting periods right away. The reports become available within 48 hours.

## How to get to the Reports dashboard

1. In the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home), select **Reports** > **Usage**.
 
2. On the **Usage** page, choose **Select a report** to select from a list of the available reports. 

## Teams activity reports that are available

There are currently two activity reports you can view:

- Microsoft Teams user activity report 
- Microsoft Teams device usage report 

### Microsoft Teams user activity report

The Microsoft Teams user activity report gives you a view of the most common activities that your users perform in Microsoft Teams. This includes how many people engage in a chat in a channel, how many communicate via private chat message, and how many participate in calls or meetings. You can see this information both at the tenant level, as well as for each individual user.

### Microsoft Teams device usage report

The Microsoft Teams app usage report provides you with information about how your users connect to Microsoft Teams, including mobile apps. The report helps you understand which devices are popular in your organization and how many users work on the go.

## Who can access the Teams activity reports

The activity reports can be accessed by users that are assigned:

- Office 365 global admin role
- Product-specific admin role (Exchange, Skype for Business, or SharePoint)
- Reports reader role

### Reports reader role

You can assign the *Reports reader* role to non-IT staff who you want to have access to these reports. By assigning this role to training managers or business stakeholders, you can make sure that they have access to the insights that are helpful to drive and track adoption of Teams.

## Other information on the Reports dashboard

### At-a-glance activity widget

The Reports dashboard includes the usage data from Microsoft Teams in the at-a-glance activity widget, which gives you a cross-product view of how users communicate and collaborate using the other various services in Office 365.

### Teams activity card

The Reports dashboard also includes a new card for Microsoft Teams. The card gives you an overview of the activity in Teams, including the number of active users, so that you can quickly understand how many users are using the service.
