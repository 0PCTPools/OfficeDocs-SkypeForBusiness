# Deploying Microsoft Teams for FrontLine Workers (FLWs) using sample scripts

When planning a new deployment of Microsoft Teams for FrontLine Worker, you may decide it would be practical to use a script to allow the deployment go quickly. The scripts we discuss in this article will help you with that deployment.

This article is recommended for people who are doing a new deployment, although you may find the scripts helpful to run in an existing environment in certain circumstances, with modifications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The scripts discussed in this article, and linked to for download, are provided as-is by Microsoft, and must be modified for your individual needs.

## The scripts

## The csv files
