# Release notes for Microsoft Teams

## June 1, 2020

### Raise hand in meetings

Users can now raise a virtual hand in a meeting! Other participants will see your raised hand next to your name in the meeting stage and next to your name in the roster.

## May 15, 2020

### Add more people to a chat

We made it possible to now add up to 350 people to a single chat thread.

## May 5, 2020

### Easily access meeting options from within a Teams meeting in progress

We're making it easier for meeting organizers to quickly and easily change their presenter and lobby settings once a Teams meeting starts by providing an easy to access link directly in the participants pane. This new functionality will be present for both scheduled and “Meet now” meetings.

### Download a participant report in a Teams meeting

Meeting organizers, especially teachers, often need to know who joined their Teams meetings. Soon you will be able to download a participant report, found in the roster view that includes join and leave times for participants. Available in the roster view, meeting organizers can download the report that includes those users who joined while the organizer was present. This feature is only available within the meeting while the meeting is active. Available on desktop (Windows and Mac) and the web.
