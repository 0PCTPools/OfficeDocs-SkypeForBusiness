# People targeting in Microsoft Teams

There may be times when you want to communicate with a subset of people in a team. To do this, you can use the people targeting feature in Teams. People targeting uses tags that can be applied to team members or groups to easily target the right subset of people. This feature lets you assign one or more tags to each person or group. You can then use the tags in @mentions to start a conversation with only those people who are assigned that tag.

Tags can be:

 - Team-scoped: The tag is applied to a person in a specific team (such as a role or a shift).
 - Tenant scoped: The tag is applied to a person or team across your organization (such as an office location).

After a tag is applied, it can be used for targeting purposes in any channel in the team. 

Here's some examples of how you can use tags in Teams:

 - A store manager wants to notify a group cashiers in a store to ask a question.
 - A charge nurse wants to message all on-call nurses in a ward.  
 - A Human Resources specialist wants to announce benefit changes to employees in a particular location.
 - A regional marketing manager wants to assign a task to all chefs located in the same Southwest region.
 - A hospital administrator wants to start a conversation with all radiologists in a hospital.

## Determine who can set tags

By default, team owners can set tags. Team owners can change the setting to allow team members to set tags.

Admins can configure a set of suggested tags, and team owners can use these suggestions, add to them, or create a totally new set of tags.
 
If you're an admin, follow these steps to create a list of suggested tags:

If you're a team owner, follow these steps to create or modify a list of tags:

## Assign a tag

In Teams, the Manage Team page contains a **Tag** column. Users can click **Tag** to see the list of suggested tags for a user, and additional tags can be added to the list.
