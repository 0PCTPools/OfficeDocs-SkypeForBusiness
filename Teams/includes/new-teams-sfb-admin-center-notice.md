The new Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center is coming soon! The new Admin Center will provide additional functionality, end-to-end insights, and the ability to manage Teams settings on a user level. Starting in March 2018, we're gradually migrating settings to the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center from both the current Skype for Business admin center and the Microsoft Teams experience in the Office 365 admin center. If a setting has been migrated, you'll see a notification in the current admin centers and then be directed to the setting's location in the new Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center.
