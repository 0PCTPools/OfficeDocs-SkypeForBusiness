Guest access and external access (federation) are different:
 
- Guest access gives access permissions to an individual. External access gives access permission to an entire domain.
- Guest access, once granted, allows a guest full access to a team (including chat and channels), and only admins can add a guest. Also, as a guest, you need to switch to the tenant in which the chat is taking place to participate in a chat with people in that tenant. If you are not in the right tenant, the chat is not accessible.
- With external access, the external chat participant has no other access to the team other than being part of a conversation. Federated chats happen in the external user's home tenant, so as an external user, you can have multiple federated chats with multiple people from different organizations without having to switch tenants.
