Set up Microsoft Teams in your Office 365 organization
======================================================

By default, Microsoft Teams is enabled for organizations who have not tried Microsoft Teams during the preview. For organizations who have been testing in preview, the setting will remain as what was set prior to general availability of Microsoft Teams.

As an administrator for your organization, you can assign user licenses to control individual access to Microsoft Teams and you can allow or block what content sources can be used in Microsoft Teams. See [Administrator settings for Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/article/3966a3f5-7e0f-4ea9-a402-41888f455ba2) for more details.

Organizations who wish to change whether Microsoft Teams is enabled or not can follow the steps below to in their Office 365 tenant:

1.  Sign in to [Office 365 Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=854665) with an account that has Global Administrator privileges.

2.  Navigate to **Settings Services** & add-ins.

At that time, access to Microsoft Teams is controlled via user-level licensing only.         |
