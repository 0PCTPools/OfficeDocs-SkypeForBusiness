# Admin quick start - Meetings and live events in Microsoft Teams

There are 2 ways to meet in Microsoft Teams - meetings and live events. Use this article to quickly roll out and configure meetings and live events for your organization. 

**Meetings** in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing. They're one of the key ways to collaborate in Teams. And you don't need to be a member of an organization (or even have a Teams account!) to join a Teams meetingâ€”just look in the invitation for instructions about calling in. 

**Live events** are an extension of Teams meetings that enable you to schedule and produce events that stream to large online audiences - up to 10,000 people.

## Get licenses for meetings and live events

To make it easy for users in your organization to schedule and hold meetings and live events, you need to acquire and assign the right licenses.

## Make sure your network's ready

If you already optimized your network when you rolled out Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you're probably all set. In any case - and especially if you're rolling out Teams quickly as your first Office 365 workload to support **remote workers** - read [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](prepare-network.md) to be sure you're ready.

## Meetings and conferencing

As the admin, you'll configure [meeting settings](meeting-settings-in-teams.md) for everyone. Then you'll use [meeting policies](meeting-policies-in-teams.md) to control what meeting features are (and aren't) available for your users. 

If your users are new to Teams meetings, share our [Manage meetings](https://support.office.com/article/join-a-teams-meeting-078e9868-f1aa-4414-8bb9-ee88e9236ee4) training with them. Check out our instructor-led online class, [Run effective meetings with Teams](https://microsoftteams.eventbuilder.com/MaximizingTeamsMeetings).

Don't forget about [managing your users' devices](device-management.md) - phones, headsets, cameras. To get the latest and up-to-date information on Teams certified devices, go to [Teams devices](https://office.com/teamsdevices).

## Live events

Similar to meetings, you - the admin - [configure live events](teams-live-events/configure-teams-live-events.md) for everyone. Then set up (and assign) [live event policies](teams-live-events/set-up-for-teams-live-events.md) to control what your users can (and can't) do.

Make sure your live event producers and organizers are trained - send them to [Set up and attend live events](https://support.office.com/article/plan-and-schedule-a-live-event-f92363a0-6d98-46d2-bdd9-f2248075e502).

If you're new to live events, check out [What are Teams live events?](teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events.md) and [Plan for Teams live events](teams-live-events/plan-for-teams-live-events.md).
