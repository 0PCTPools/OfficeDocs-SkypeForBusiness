# Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization

An emergency location must be associated with a phone number, but when this happens can vary between country/regions. For example, in the United States, you need to associate an emergency location when you assign the phone number to the user. In the United Kingdom, you need to associate an emergency location to the phone number when you're getting the phone numbers from Office 365 or transferring phone numbers from your current service provider.

No matter which country/region you are in, it's possible to add a place or places to an emergency location or remove an emergency location. Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization, you can create them for buildings, floors, and offices. See [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](/microsoftteams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing).
  
To learn how to get a Calling Plan and how much they cost, see [Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
## Add an emergency location

2. Click **Add Location**.
3. Enter a name and description for the location.
4. Select the country or region, and then enter the address.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, and Spain it is important to understand that in order to successfully activate a phone number in Office 365, the address setup in the emergency location, which will be used to acquire the number, must match the phone numberâ€™s area code.
5. If the address isn't found and you want to manually edit the address, turn on **Let me edit the address form manually if the address selected can't be found**.
6. Click **Save**.
