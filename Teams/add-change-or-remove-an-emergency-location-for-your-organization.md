# Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization

An emergency address must be associated with a phone number, but when this happens can vary between country/regions. For example, in the United States, you need to associate an emergency address when you assign the phone number to the user. In the United Kingdom, you need to associate an emergency address to the phone number when you're getting the phone numbers from Office 365 or transferring phone numbers from your current service provider.

No matter which country/region you are in, it's possible to add a location or locations to an emergency address or remove an emergency address. Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization, you can create them for buildings, floors, and offices. See [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](/microsoftteams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing).
  
To learn how to get a Calling Plan and how much they cost, see [Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
