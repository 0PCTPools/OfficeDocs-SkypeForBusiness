# Roll out Microsoft Teams First starting from Skype for Business Server

Use the guidance in this article if Microsoft Teams is the first Office 365 workload you're rolling out. If you've already rolled out Office 365 with other workloads, use the guidance in [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](../Skype/SfbHybrid/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity.md) instead.

## Prerequisites

Regardless of your starting point, you need to take care of the [Prerequisites to rolling out Teams](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md#before-you-get-started) first.

## Teams First starting from Skype for Business Server

Use this guidance to roll out Teams as your first Office 365 workload if your organization is running Skype for Business Server or Lync Server.

Note: Tenants created after September 1st 2019 are provisioned in Teams Only mode. 
Important: If you have Skype for Business Server deployed, and your tenant was provisioned AFTER September 1st 2019, please contact premier support to enable coexistence capabilities for Teams. Make sure your 'Organization wide upgrade policy' is set to 'Island mode' before you assign any Teams license to a user.
