# Drive awareness and implement training for Microsoft Teams

Awareness and training are the marketing and communications segment of your overall adoption strategy. This will ensure that your employees are aware of the new capabilities of Microsoft Teams and its underlying Office 365 services and apps.
   
For both your initial pilots and your eventual company-wide roll out, your internal communications should be a priority. They should include:

- Internal awareness materials such as posters, digital signage and events.
- Self-help and training information in a single location.

For your pilot phases these are the minimum steps for success:

- Have a regular scheduled meeting with your project stakeholders for updates.
- Make self-help documentation available, including product videos.
- Hold a kick-off meeting with the pilot users to get them excited about their participation. The importance of creating a sense of community with enthusiasm can't be overstated.

Once you have worked through the initial pilot, you can expand the efforts above to reach your entire organization. Depending on your size, this may take time and be approached in phases by region, user profile, or organization. During this larger scale roll out, encourage the involvement of the communicators in your organization. We recommend these individuals be involved early and often as you use the available adoption materials or design your own.

If your company has a central intranet portal for news, information, or support, you can use it as a hub for information about this roll out. Providing widely available self-help information, training, and written guidance lets users quickly come onboard. Many users will simply jump in once Teams becomes available and we encourage this. We also know that each individual learns in different ways; a central information portal can support all styles of learning within your organization.

## Measure and share success

As with any communications and adoption campaign, you will want to identify your success measurements up front. Consider these:

- Active users in the product
- Views of your information webpages
- Questions in your user community
- Views of your training videos
- Attendance at learning events

Share the insights you get from your feedback channels with the hashtag #TeamsStories for easy retrieval. Share a #TeamsStory per month on your intranet to highlight employees who are embracing the change to increase productivity and collaboration in your environment. Also share them with us in our Driving Adoption forum on the Microsoft Technical Community. Sharing these real world examples from within your own company is extremely valuable to realizing sustained change over time with your user community.

## Ongoing improvements

In collaboration with your technical implementation team, plan to hold monthly service health reviews for Microsoft Teams. In these reviews you will share insights on the following measures:

- Service usage – Active usage data. May include information about services deprecated or consumption reduced as a result of moving to Microsoft Teams.  Normally led by service manager or product owner for collaboration services.
- Service health – Call quality, meeting health, and overall service health. Review of any support incidents and helpdesk ticket levels. Discussion of security and governance topics. Normally led by information protection and support teams. 
- Capability/project roadmap – What is the schedule of remaining employee onboarding or further collaboration improvement projects? What additional features is your organization going to enable? Normally led by service manager or product owner for collaboration services in collaboration with key business stakeholders. 
- Awareness campaign and training success measurement update – Includes reach, participation, key feedback themes, and open issues. Include key wins and success stories.
 
Monthly reviews can be quite formal in large organizations or they can be virtual meetings in smaller companies.It's important to share and monitor this data to ensure a healthy and increasingly vibrant implementation of Microsoft Teams.
