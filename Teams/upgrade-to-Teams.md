# Upgrade to Microsoft Teams

Congratulations on your pending upgrade to Microsoft Teams! Teams combines everything you know and appreciate about Skype for Business with the addition of collaboration tools, app integration, and file storage, creating a true hub for teamwork.

Whether your organization is already using Teams alongside Skype for Business or you're just getting started with Teams, Microsoft is here to support you through the upgrade process. Your success is our success.

> [!Important]
> Teams has the power to transform the way your users work. A successful upgrade will include both technical and user readiness-focused activities.

To facilitate your upgrade to Teams, Microsoft is working hard to bring you the right level of guidance for your organization, whether it's a small organization, a large enterprise, or somewhere in between. Below are some resources to get you started. More information will be coming online over time, so please check back when your organization is ready to upgrade from Skype for Business to Teams.

| Designed for smaller organizations or those with simple deployments of Skype for Business (IM only or IM plus basic meeting functionality), the [Upgrade Essentials checklist](upgrade-essentials.md) steps you through activities designed to quickly move your entire organization to Teams. | (Coming mid-2018) Designed for enterprise customers, or those with more tailored deployments such as hybrid or voice, the Upgrade Pro guide details technical and user readiness activities to better meet the unique attributes of an organization. |
