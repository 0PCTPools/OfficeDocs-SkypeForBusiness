# Upgrade to Microsoft Teams

Supporting Microsoft’s intelligent communications vision, Microsoft Teams is the central hub for teamwork, bringing together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage. As an existing Skype for Business customer, we invite you to upgrade to Microsoft Teams, enabling you to experience this full suite of communication and collaboration capabilities in a single client experience.

We understand that your upgrade journey may take some time and, as a valued Skype for Business customer, Microsoft is here to support you every step of the way. Whether you are just getting started with Teams, already using Teams alongside Skype for Business or ready to upgrade, we are working hard to bring you the right level of guidance for your organization and encourage you to take the next steps to begin realizing the value Teams can offer your organization.

We understand that customers are not a one-sized-fits-all. For added flexibility, we’ve organized the framework into two paths, Upgrade Essentials and Upgrade Pro, enabling you to select the optimal upgrade journey to meet your organization’s needs.

-  **Upgrade Essentials** is designed for smaller customers or those with simple deployments (eg IM only), who can quickly and easily move all of their users to Teams at once.
-  **Upgrade Pro** is targeted for customers with more complex deployment scenarios (eg hybrid, Voice workloads, etc) who may require more time to upgrade as well as benefit from a phased upgrade approach.

> [!Important]
> If you are an Admin on your O365 tenant, you may start seeing upgrade options in your PowerShell cmdlet or Teams Admin Portal. Having the option to upgrade doesn’t necessarily mean your organization is ready for this change. For an optimal user experience, be sure to validate feature availability, as well as technical and user readiness prior to activating any upgrade options for your tenant.
