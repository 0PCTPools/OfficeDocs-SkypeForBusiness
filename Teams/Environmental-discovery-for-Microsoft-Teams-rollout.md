Environmental discovery for Microsoft Teams rollout
===================================================

Discovery is one of the very first and key steps that you should take when
planning for your journey to Microsoft Teams.

You should perform a detailed discovery of your environment to better understand
the current state and to reveal any difficulties or even further, possible
blockers to the execution of your Teams rollout.

Discovery Questionnaire
=======================

The sample questionnaire below walks you through a set of questions to confirm
readiness of your organization to the successful rollout of Audio Conferencing
and Phone System with Calling Plans capabilities in Teams.

All matters related to existing collaboration infrastructure and Office 365
Tenant, networking, endpoints, operations and, adoption and readiness are
included as part of the environmental discovery questionnaire.

The questionnaire is broken down into multiple sections to confirm readiness for
your Microsoft Teams deployment. Work with your project team to provide the
requested information as detailed as possible to facilitate the planning
activities.

You may start with copying the questionnaire into a Microsoft Word document. Try
to answer all questions and capture all the details as you move through.
