# Facilitate user adoption of your new online phone system

A phone can be a user’s lifeline. Switching from a traditional phone system to an online phone system represents a significant change in the way users work, and can negatively affect productivity. Taking time to inform, guide, and support users through this change can help ensure a positive user experience and maximize your return on investment.

This article contains customizable email templates to help inform users about their new phone system. Customize and send the appropriate emails to align with your specific voice deployment. We’ve used brackets to indicate sections for easy personalization, but we recommend that you add organization-specific messaging to make the announcement most relevant for your users.

## Email number 1: Send three weeks before launch

Subject Line: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT about your office desk phone

Body of email:

```
Instant messaging and online meetings have become a common way to communicate
with others, but your phone can still be a lifeline to getting your job done.
From building rapport when you can’t be there in person to maintaining momentum
on a project, sometimes it’s easier to just pick up the phone and talk to
someone. At the same time, we understand that many of you work remotely, have
flexible work schedules or travel frequently and can’t be tethered to your
desk or phone all day.

To better adapt to how you work, we want to ensure you have flexibility in how
you communicate including being able to make and receive phone calls from
anywhere, at any time. We're excited to announce that you'll soon be able
to use <Skype for Business/Teams> as your phone. This upgrade will provide
instant messaging, online meetings and phone calling all in one application,
simplifying the way you work.

Using <Skype for Business/Teams> as your phone offers...

-   Flexibility - Make and receive calls anywhere, any time, across
    devices

-   Adaptability - Easily move between your headset and a variety of
    devices, including mobile

-   Capability - Transfer calls to an internal contact, external number or
    even your voicemail

-   Productivity - Call your contacts with one click, alleviating the need
    to remember phone numbers

When will phone calling be available?

We understand this is a big shift in the way you make calls today and want to
ensure you have everything you need to get started. Phone capabilities will be
enabled on <insert date>, but you can start preparing today.
