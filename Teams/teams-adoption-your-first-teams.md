# Create your first teams in Microsoft Teams

The best way to drive adoption of Teams is to use the product. We recommend that you manage your Office 365 deployment with Teams. You should also create a community of employees who are focused on teamwork and productivity. (These initial teams may change over time.) Here are our suggestions for your first teams.

## Create a "Getting to know Teams" team

We believe that your initial project team would benefit from a “Getting to know Teams” team, to ensure that they are set up from a client perspective, have a few great initial conversations, and explore what Teams could do for them. In addition to your project team, you may already have a group of people in the company who enjoy getting early access to new capabilities. This can be one of their initial teams when you bring them on board, and will help you to immediately start getting feedback.

You and your team should use the notification tools to monitor all channels and make sure that new members feel welcome.

| Channel name | Use and initial text | Tabs, bots, and apps |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| General | Welcome to Teams. This team will help you get to know Teams, ensure that you are set up from a client perspective, have a few great initial conversations, and explore what Teams can do for you. | None |
| Say Hi | Introduce yourself to the team and share what you want to get from Teams. | None |
| How do I ? | A channel to ask how to questions.</br>Step 1 – install the desktop and mobile clients.</br>Step 2 – jump into Teams.| Pinned tab that links to the [Microsoft Teams help center](https://support.office.com/teams)</br>Pinned tab that links to end user training videos</br>Pinned tab that links to client installation page |
| Feedback | Share your thoughts on your initial Teams experiences | Pinned tab with Polly Poll|
| Ideas for future teams | Share your thoughts on where Teams can drive additional value in your company. What could these teams be called? Who would be members? ||
| Support | If something is not working as expected use this channel to share your experience and get answers ||

As you create these teams, use an invitation email to invite people to the team and tell them what to expect. For example:

    Welcome to Microsoft Teams for <insert_company_name>. 

    We have recently started the rollout of Teams. We created a team so that you and your colleagues can experiment, ask questions, and see the possibilities of Teams.

In addition to this “Getting to Know Teams” team, we suggest creating teams for both your project team and your teamwork champions. These teams will be essential to your success as you begin to experiment with the product. Our suggested structure for those teams is as follows:  



| Team Name | Proposed Channel Names |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Microsoft Teams Implementation | General <br/> Awareness and Adoption <br/> Business Engagement <br/> Early Adopter Program <br/> Feedback and Insights <br/> Security and Compliance <br/> Strategy and Planning <br/> Service Health and Incidents <br/> Training <br/> Watercooler Chat |
| Teamwork Champions | General <br/> Best Practices, Training, and How To <br/> Champion Corner <br/> Feedback and Support <br/> Program Leads <br/> Social Hub |

Within Microsoft Teams, the [tab gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/tabs/tabs-overview) gives you access to all Office 365 and third-party apps that have been turned on by the administrator. To get the most value from your product, we suggest pinning key resources as tabs in each of the appropriate channels. See the example below.

In your initial teams, we suggest pinning the following items for easy reference in your team channels. These assets are in addition to your OneNote notebook sections. If you are working with our FastTrack team, they will assist you in configuring these first teams.

## Making the switch to Microsoft Teams

As you begin to use Teams, it will be important for you and the rest of the project team to commit to using Teams chat, channels, and resources to run your project. Your own usage of Teams is critical to the quality of your adoption project. We recommend that you resist fragmenting your project by continuing to have conversations with the core project team in email. By switching to Teams you will model the behavior you ultimately want your employees to embrace. Set the tone, go first, and begin to enjoy having your project information in one place!
