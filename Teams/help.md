Help experience in Microsoft Teams
============================================

For help while using Microsoft Teams, ensure your users and champions get familiar with the Help options accessed from the icon in the lower left of the desktop and web experience.   

Microsoft Teams provides localized language support for help content. New languages are being added all the time. For the most current list of supported languages, see [Microsoft Teams supported languages for help content](https://support.office.com/article/Microsoft-Teams-supported-languages-for-help-content-9c71d10a-0c5c-49d4-b6d7-0c58cdfdf4cf).

- Browse Topics
  This area will take you to help content by feature and function within the prodcut.  Simple and straightforward guidance to help users get the most from the Teams experience. 

- Videos
  Our on demand video content enables users to learn specific tasks quickly. We are continue to produce additional videos for this experience. Access to the internet is required for these vidoes to properly stream to your user community. 

- What's New
  Periodic release notes for users and team owners about new capabilities or changes to features in the product.

- Share an Idea
  We always want to hear from you about how to improve our product.  This option will redirect you to our product feedback forum where you can submit new feature requests or vote on ones that exist.  We are constantly reviewing this information as we plan our feature delivery schedule. 

> [!NOTE]
> We have depricated the T-Bot experience within the product.  Some users may see a historic chat icon for T-Bot in their individual chat history.  Clicking on this icon will direct them to the new help experience.
