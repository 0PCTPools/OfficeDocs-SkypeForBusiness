## What are add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams features. Some businesses want the flexibility of purchasing only specific features at a competitive price. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

Depending on which plan you already have, you can buy add-on licenses for the following Microsoft Teams features:

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Feature** <br/> |**Description** <br/> |
|**Audio Conferencing** <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Teams meeting, instead of using their computer. Use the Audio Conferencing feature for this situation.  <br/> To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/online-meeting-solutions).  <br/> |
|**Toll free numbers for dial-in access to your conferences, and the ability to dial out from a conference to add someone by calling any telephone number in the world** <br/> |If you add Audio Conferencing, we recommend that you [Set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). <br/> |
|**Phone System** <br/> |A PBX is a telephone system in a business. Phone System in Office 365 is a hosted telephone service. It gives you both traditional and innovative PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment. [Here's what you get with Phone System in Office 365](../here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md).  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Phone System](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/voice-calling).  <br/> |
|**Calling Plans** <br/> |Calls to other Teams users are free, but if you want your users to be able to call any phone numbers outside of your business, get a [Calling Plan](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md). There are Domestic Calling Plans and Domestic and International Calling Plans in Office 365.  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Calling Plan Pricing](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/voice-calling).  <br/> |
|**Microsoft Teams Rooms** <br/> |This isn't an add-on, but a feature that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. See [Microsoft Teams Rooms](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/license-options-based-on-your-plan/skype-room-systems-v2).  <br/> |

## How to see prices and buy add-on licenses
For most businesses, buying a bundle of software in an Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with higher combined cost.

For more cost information, see one of the following:

- [Pricing for Phone System and Calling Plans](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/voice-calling)

## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

## How do I use my existing Calling Plans with Teams?

If you are using on-premises PSTN connectivity for hybrid users, you  *only*  assign **Phone System** licenses to your users. **DO NOT** also assign a Calling Plan.

### Assigning add-on licenses for your Teams users
After you decide on which features you want for your Teams users, you will need to assign the correct licenses for them.

#### Assigning licenses for Small Businesses (less than 300 people)
Procedure for M365 SMB plans. Go to MAC > Active Users > choose a user > licenses > pick Business Voice.

Procedure for Enterprise or large businesses. Go to MAC > Active Users > choose a user > licenses > pick which features you want.

## Assigning add-on licenses in bulk
You can use WIndows PowerShell to assign multiple users a license for Business Voice, Phone System , Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans.
