Before creating a team, it's a good practice to think about a goal, project, or work item and the organization’s people or groups who can help deliver it collaboratively. Once created, add these people or groups to a team to start collaborating. It's a good idea to designate multiple owners for each team - see [Managing teams](https://support.office.com/article/Teams-and-Channels-df38ae23-8f85-46d3-b071-cb11b9de5499).

You may start with a small number of team members to brainstorm as you move forward, and then add new people or groups as you go. The great thing with Microsoft Teams, is that when you add new people or groups, they can quickly get up to speed on what has already been discussed as the conversations and files are available to users regardless of when they join. Try to avoid creating different teams that have the same set of members, as this approach may not provide the desired focus to deliver the project or goal. Outlook is a great tool for sharing those types of group-wide communications.

Once you've created your team, it’s a good idea to start to think about the different areas of conversations that you want to have to drive towards your goal and create initial channels so that people know where to contribute and to find existing conversations. Be descriptive when naming channels to make it easier to understand what the conversation in the channel is there to achieve. You can add new Tabs to channels to add tools like OneNote, PowerBI or links to web pages and other content to make it easy for people to find content and share their thoughts.

The **General channel** is created for you when you create the team. You can use this to share an overview of what the team wants to achieve and other high-level information that a new team member would find useful. Currently, you cannot remove or unfavorite the General channel. The General channel is a great place to pin a project charter or welcome deck to your project. This ensures that as new people onboard your team, they have a single source of truth for your objectives. When naming channels, remember that the channels will be ordered alphabetically after the General channel.
