# Raise your hand in Teams meetings

During a Microsoft Teams meeting, a participant might have a question. To get the speaker's and moderator's attention, a participant can use the raise your hand option to ask a question. A meeting moderator might want to take a quick poll, and the raised hand can be used to count the meeting participants' responses. 

This feature is important for the following reasons:

- Participants can signal that they want to talk without disrupting the meeting. 

- The moderator or speaker can see if anyone in the meeting wants to talk.  

- Raise your hand makes meetings more inclusive by encouraging participation from remote participants. 

- Presenters in meetings need a mechanism to take questions in a structured manner.  

A Teams admin doesn't have to create a policy for the feature to appear in a meeting. Raise your hand is available by default and is currently supported for web and mobile meetings.
 
## Raise your hand display

Raise your hand is visible to all meeting participants and indicated by a hand icon.

- Raised hands are shown in the meeting stage, roster (sorted by duration), and when sharing content.

- The raised hand animates to draw attention.

- A yellow shade is shown on a participant who raises the hand. 

- A raised hand is visible either in the roster or meeting stage, depending on what is currently being shared in the meeting.

## Raise your hand settings 

Participants and presenters can take advantage of several raise your hand settings: 

|Item  |Presenter |Organizer | Participant|
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
|Raise hand <sup>1</sup>   |Yes        |Yes       |Yes |

|Configure raise hand settings during a meeting  |Yes        |Yes        |No|

<sup>2</sup> A participant is notified by audio if the raise your hand was lowered for them.
