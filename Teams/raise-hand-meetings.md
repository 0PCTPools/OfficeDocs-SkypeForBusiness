# Raise your hand option in Teams meetings

During a Microsoft Teams meeting, a participant use can the **Raise your hand** option to get the speaker's and moderator's attention. If a meeting moderator wants to take a quick poll, then the **Raise your hand** option can be used to count the meeting participants' responses.
