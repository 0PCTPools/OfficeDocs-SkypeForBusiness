Welcome to Microsoft Teams
==========================

Microsoft Teams is the Office 365 digital equivalent of an open-space office environment. *What's the approved blurb we should put here?*

This will be the landing page when people come to docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams. Highly designed page, with tiles, pictures, etc.

*Note: We may decide to put this page one level up, as a Teams node page. We can try it both ways and see what flows best. If we move this page up to a Teams node page, we can delete this "Welcome" topic and default to the Overview of Microsoft Teams topic instead.*

**Key scenarios**

*This is a sample set only - replace with the "real" set.*

- I'm new to Office 365 and Microsoft Teams - help me get started

- We're already using Skype for Business Online, and some people in my organization are using Microsoft Teams

- We're using Skype for Business Online, and I've been told we're upgrading to Microsoft Teams soon

- I need help managing or troubleshooting Microsoft Teams for my organization

- Help me set up PSTN calling in Microsoft Teams

- Help me set up PSTN conferencing in Microsoft Teams
