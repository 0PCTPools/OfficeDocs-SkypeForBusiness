# Upgrade Pro

Designed for larger organizations—or those with highly customized deployments of Skype for Business—Upgrade Pro guidance accounts for a longer upgrade lifecycle in addition to a variety of upgrade scenarios (voice, hybrid, Skype Room Systems, and so on), which will be covered in the coming months. Monitor the roadmap for the enhancements that are planned for Microsoft Teams; this will help you identify the right upgrade timeline for your organization. 

Although your organization might not be ready to upgrade just yet, we recommend getting started with the pre-upgrade activities listed below. Not only will your organization be able to start realizing the value of Teams, you’ll be able to accelerate your upgrade from Skype for Business as soon as Teams is ready for you.

## Pre-upgrade activities

**Prepare your organization for Teams.**  To help ensure a successful upgrade to Teams, it’s critical that you devote ample time in preparation. You can start realizing the value of Teams as you prepare for your upgrade. If you’ve already enabled Teams alongside Skype for Business, use these pre-upgrade activities as a checkpoint to validate your organization’s readiness before you upgrade users to Teams.

> [!Important]
> If you’re an admin on your Office 365 tenant, you might start seeing upgrade options in your PowerShell cmdlet or Teams Admin Center. Having the option to upgrade doesn’t necessarily mean your organization is ready for this change. For an optimal user experience, be sure to validate that the features you need are available, and verify that your technical team and user population are ready before you activate any upgrade options for your tenant.
