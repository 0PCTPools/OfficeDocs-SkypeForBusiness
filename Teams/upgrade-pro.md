# Upgrade Pro

Designed for larger organizations or those with complex deployments of Skype for Business (for example, hybrid or cloud voice deployments), Upgrade Pro accounts for a longer upgrade lifecycle along with a variety of upgrade scenarios, including running Microsoft Teams alongside Skype for Business until Teams is ready for your organization. 

Segmented into three phases, Upgrade Pro covers:

-   **Pre-upgrade**: Start realizing the value of Teams as you prepare for your upgrade over time. Consider these steps an upgrade prerequisite to help ensure a positive experience as you transition to Teams when it’s ready for you. If your organization has already been running Teams alongside Skype for Business, use these pre-upgrade activities as a validation checkpoint for your organization’s readiness to upgrade users to Teams.
-    **Upgrade**: When your organization is ready for users to stop using Skype for Business, you’ll want to ensure they have ample notice to get training and start using Teams (if they haven’t already). You’ll also want to take steps such as moving their Skype for Business meetings to Teams to ensure an optimal experience.
-    **Post-upgrade**: After your entire organization is on Teams, implement a plan to maximize value. This includes monitoring your network for quality, promoting adoption of Teams while ensuring that Skype for Business usage is winding down, and planning for expanded functionality as the Teams roadmap continues to evolve.

Although your organization might not be ready to upgrade just yet, we recommend getting started with the pre-upgrade activities listed below. Not only will your organization be able to quickly start realizing the value of Teams, you’ll be able to accelerate your upgrade from Skype for Business as soon as Teams is ready for you. Monitor the [roadmap](https://aka.ms/skype2teamsroadmap) for the enhancements that are planned for Teams; this will help you identify the right upgrade timeline for your organization.


## Pre-upgrade

**Prepare your organization for Teams.**  To help ensure a successful upgrade to Teams, it’s critical that you devote ample time in preparation. You can start realizing the value of Teams as you prepare for your upgrade. If you’ve already enabled Teams alongside Skype for Business, use these pre-upgrade activities as a checkpoint to validate your organization’s readiness before you upgrade users to Teams.

Our Upgrade Pro content is continually evolving. More information will be available soon, including new upgrade and post-upgrade articles.

> [!Important]
> If you’re an admin on your Office 365 tenant, you might start seeing upgrade options in your PowerShell cmdlet or Teams Admin Center. Having the option to upgrade doesn’t necessarily mean your organization is ready for this change. For an optimal user experience, confirm that Teams meets your collaboration and communication requirements, validate that your network is ready to support Teams, and implement your user readiness plan before upgrading users to Teams.
