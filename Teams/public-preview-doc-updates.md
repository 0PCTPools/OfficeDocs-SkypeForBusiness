# Microsoft Teams Public Preview

> [!NOTE]
> Features included in preview might not be complete, and might undergo changes before becoming available in the public release. They're provided for evaluation and exploration purposes only.

Public Preview for Microsoft Teams provides early access to unreleased features in Teams. Previews allow you to explore and test upcoming features. We also welcome feedback on any feature in public previews. Public preview is enabled each Teams user, so you don't need to worry about affecting your entire organization.

## Enable public preview

Public preview is enabled for each user, and the option to turn on public preview is controlled in an admin policy.

### On a desktop or web client

To enable the public preview on a desktop or web client, you need to do the following tasks:

1. Enable uploading of apps in the admin center of your tenant as described in [Prepare your Office 365 tenant](../platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).
2. Enable public developer preview as described in [Public developer preview in Teams](../platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md)
3. Select your profile to display the Teams menu.
4. Select **About** → **Developer preview**.
5. Select **Switch to Developer preview**.

### On a mobile client

To enable the public preview on a mobile client, you need to do the following tasks:

1. Open the hamburger menu, then select Settings.
2. Select **About**.
3. Select the **Public preview** toggle.
4. Disable public preview
5. Use the same menu item under **About** → **Public preview**, and select it to turn it off.
You might need to restart Teams after switching to Public preview.
