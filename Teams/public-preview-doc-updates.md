Public preview in Microsoft Teams
======================================================

> [!NOTE] Features included in preview may not be complete, and may undergo changes before becoming available in the public release. They are provided for testing and exploration purposes only. In Phase 0, public preview is supported on Windows 10 and Windows 10 browsers. 

Public Preview is a public program for a Microsoft Teams user which provides early access to unreleased features in Teams. This preview allows you to explore and test upcoming features. We also welcome feedback on any feature in public preview. Public preview is enabled per Teams client, so you don't need to worry about affecting your entire organization. 

## Enable public preview

Public preview is enabled on a per-client basis, but the option to turn on public preview is controlled in an admin policy.

1. Click on your profile to display the Teams menu.
2. Select About → Public preview.
