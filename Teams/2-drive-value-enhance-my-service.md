# Enhance my service

After you’ve successfully deployed Audio Conferencing or Phone System with
Calling Plans services to your organization, and are operating the service with
quality and reliability, the next step is to regularly evaluate whether you have
any opportunities to enhance your services.

A great way to make sure you’re always getting the most out of your services is
to monitor the Teams public roadmaps for new feature enhancements that might be
of interest to your organization.

Additionally, because organizations grow and change, you should take time to
revisit and update your business use cases at regular intervals to make sure the
service is configured to meet your organization’s current needs.

When you do see opportunities to enhance your service, take the time to do it
right. Loop back to the start of the entire deployment process, and apply the
same guidance end to end. When making small, incremental changes, it’s unlikely
that you’ll need to complete all activities and tasks in full, but you should be
sure to evaluate each activity and task along the way to give yourself the best
chance at a successful outcome.
