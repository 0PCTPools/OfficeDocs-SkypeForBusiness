|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Phone System in Office 365 feature** <br/> |**Description** <br/> |
|[Cloud auto attendants](what-are-phone-system-auto-attendants.md) <br/> |Create a menu system that enables external and internal callers to locate and place or transfer calls to company users or departments in your organization.  <br/> |
|[Cloud call queues](create-a-phone-system-call-queue.md) <br/> |Set up greetings that are used when someone calls in to a phone number for your organization, the ability to automatically put the calls on hold, and the ability to search for the next available call agent to handle the call while the people who call are listening to music on hold.  <br/> |
|Music on hold | Plays default music defined by the service when an external call from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is placed on hold. This feature works for one-to-one PSTN-to-Teams calls in addition to calls made to a call queue. This feature provides on-hold notification parity with other platforms. On first release, this feature is not configurable by the administrator. Hold music is also not supported in consultative transfer of a PSTN call.|
|Call answer/initiate (by name and number)  <br/> |Lets users answer inbound calls with a touch, and place outbound calls either by dialing the full phone number or clicking a name in the client.  <br/> |
|[Call forwarding options and simultaneous ring](https://support.office.com/article/call-forwarding-call-groups-and-simultaneous-ring-in-teams-a88da9e8-1343-4d3c-9bda-4b9615e4183e) <br/> |Lets users set up forwarding rules so calls can go with them anywhere, or they can be forwarded to colleagues or to voicemail.  <br/> |
|[Group call pickup and forward to group](call-sharing-and-group-call-pickup.md) <br/> | Lets users share incoming calls with colleagues so that the colleagues can answer calls that occur while the user is unavailable. Less disruptive to recipients than other forms of call sharing (such as call forwarding or simultaneous ringing) because users can configure how they want to be notified of an incoming shared call. |
|[Transfer a call and consultive transfer](https://support.office.com/article/Transfer-a-call-in-Teams-b7f40f14-e083-46b9-b739-68038c8f73a0) <br/> |Lets users transfers calls to another person. Or, if they need to leave their office but want to continue the conversation, they can transfer the calls from their PC or IP phone to their cell phone or tablet.  <br/> |
|[Call park and retrieve](call-park-and-retrieve.md)  <br/> | Lets a user place a call on hold in the Teams service in the cloud. When a call is parked, the service generates a unique code for call retrieval. The user who parked the call or someone else can then use that code and a supported app or device to retrieve the call. <br/> |
|[Caller ID](how-can-caller-id-be-used-in-your-organization.md)  <br/> |Calls from inside the company display a detailed caller ID that pulls information from the corporate directory, showing picture ID and job title instead of just a phone number. For calls from external phone numbers, the caller ID as provided by the phone service provider is displayed. If the external phone numbers are secondary numbers in the corporate directory, then the information from the corporate directory will be displayed.  <br/> |
|Device switching  <br/> |Lets users play a call or meeting on another device.  <br/> |
|Presence-based call routing <br/> |Controls inbound communications with presence, enabling the user to block all incoming communication except from those specifically indicated.  <br/> |
|Enterprise calendar call routing  <br/> |Lets users use Exchange calendar business hours to enable or disable call forwarding and simultaneous ringing in the client.  <br/> |
|[Integrated dial pad](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-the-dial-pad-in-teams-27bc60b5-74c0-4e9c-808b-da4db9514d89) <br/> | Lets users dial by name or by number anywhere in the search bar and in the dial pad, speeding up the process of making outbound calls. <br/> |
|Federated calling  <br/> |Lets users search for anyone in the client directory, then securely connect, communicate, and collaborate with them.  <br/> |
|[Make and receive a video call](https://support.office.com/article/abf62493-670f-4b0d-b2cf-fe03b49caf42) <br/> | Lets users see the speaker's name and video stream in a small floating window.<br/> |
|[Cloud voicemail](set-up-phone-system-voicemail.md) <br/> | When a user receives a voicemail, it is delivered to their Exchange mailbox as an email with the voicemail message as an attachment. They can also listen to their messages over their certified desktop phone,and all Teams or Skype for Business applications.   <br/> |
|Reverse number lookup | Shows called ID for an external phone number if the number is associated with a user in Azure AD. If the phone number is not in Azure AD, the telco provided display name will be shown if it is available.  |
|[Secondary ringer](https://support.office.com/article/Manage-your-call-settings-in-Teams-456cb611-3477-496f-b31a-6ab752a7595f) <br/> | Lets users with multiple certified devices set one as the secondary ringer, which means the device will ring when a call comes in. |
|[Distinctive ring alerts](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-your-call-settings-in-Teams-456cb611-3477-496f-b31a-6ab752a7595f)<br/> |Lets a user play different ringtones for the different types of calls they get every day.  <br/> |
|[Shared Line Appearance](shared-line-appeareance.md) <br/> | Lets a user choose a delegate to answer or handle calls on their behalf.|
|[Busy on Busy](teams-calling-policy.md) (Teams Only?) <br/> | Calling policy that lets you configure how incoming calls are handled when a user is already in a call or conference or has a call placed on hold. |
|[Call Blocking](https://support.office.com/article/manage-your-call-settings-in-teams-456cb611-3477-496f-b31a-6ab752a7595f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) <br/> | Lets users block unwanted PSTN calls.|
|[Common Area Phones](set-up-common-area-phones.md) <br/> | A common area phone is typically placed in an area like a lobby or conference room making it available to multiple people. Common area phones are set up as devices rather than users, and can automatically sign into a network.|
|[Media bypass support](direct-routing-plan-media-bypass) (for Teams Direct Routing only) <br/> | For better performance, media is kept between the Session Border Controller (SBC) and the client instead of sending it via the Microsoft Phone System. |
|Compliance recording for PSTN (Teams only) <br/> | Is this a released feature?|
