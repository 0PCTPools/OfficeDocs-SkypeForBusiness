# Secure Messaging

Secure messaging is valuable in a Healthcare context, where a message arriving and being acted upon can truly be a matter of life and death. Teams supports secure messaging in the following ways:

- When enabled by the administrator, users can set a priority for chat messages sent to other users. This can help the message recipient quickly see what needs immediate attention and what is "nice-to-know."
- When enabled by an administrator, if a users sends a message and requests it, they will be notified when the recipient reads the message.

Both of these settings are available in the Microsoft Teams admin center as options in a Messaging policy.
