# Firstline Worker features coming soon to Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We’re building StaffHub capabilities into Microsoft Teams. Today, Teams includes the Shifts app for schedule management and additional capabilities will roll out over time. StaffHub will stop working for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who tries to open StaffHub will be shown a message directing them to download Teams.

Here's a list of features for Firstline Workers that are coming soon to Teams:

- Corporate announcements
- Kronos integration
- Tasks
- Home screen landing page
- Adding custom fields on a team

Due to a limitation on customizations and the unique platform structure in Teams, the following features will not be available in Teams:

- Flow connectors
- Shifts or StaffHub access for non-Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users
- Conditional access for StaffHub
- Intune MAM for StaffHub*
- Adding employee resources for your organization**

*You will not be able to manage Intune MAM for StaffHub or Shifts, however, you can manage Intune MAM security with Teams. To learn more, see [Overview of security and compliance in Teams](../../security-compliance-overview.md).

**You will no longer be able to distribute shared employee resources with your Firstline Workforce at scale in Teams. Instead, you can manually add a tab for files or websites in your teams for quick content access. To learn more, see [How to use Teams tabs](https://office365adoption.com/microsoft-teams-tabs/). Or, you can use Teams Microsoft Graph APIs to programattically add the same tab to any teams that need to access the same shared resources. To learn more, see [Add tab to channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/teamstab-add?view=graph-rest-1.0).

We're committed to building capabilities to meet the needs of your Firstline Workforce and want to hear from you, send us feedback on [UserVoice](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public-preview/category/182881-developer-platform).
