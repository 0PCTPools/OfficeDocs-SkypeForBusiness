# Firstline Worker capabilities coming soon to Microsoft Teams

Here's a list of features for Firstline Workers that are coming soon to Teams:

- Corporate announcements
- Kronos integration
- Tasks
- Home screen landing page
- Adding custom fields on a team

Due to a limitation on customizations and the unique platform structure in Teams, the following features will not be available in Teams:

- Flow connectors
- Shifts or StaffHub access for non-AAD users 
- Conditional access for StaffHub
- Intune MAM for StaffHub*
- Adding employee resources for your organization**

*You will not be able to manage Intune MAM for StaffHub or Shifts, however, you can manage Intune MAM security with Teams. To learn more, see [Overview of security and compliance in Teams](../../security-compliance-overview.md).

**You will no longer be able to determine what content is shared with your Firstline Workforce once they sign in to Teams. Instead, you can manually tab files in your teams for quick document access. To learn more, see [Add tab to channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/teamstab-add?view=graph-rest-1.0).

We're committed to building capabilities to meet the needs of your Firstline Workforce and want to hear from you, send us feedback on [UserVoice](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public-preview/category/182881-developer-platform).
