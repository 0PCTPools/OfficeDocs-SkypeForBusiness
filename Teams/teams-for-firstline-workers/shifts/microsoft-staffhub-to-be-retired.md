# Microsoft StaffHub to be retired

Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. The Teams mobile app now includes shift management and a home screen experience. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out to Teams over time. 

These changes are part of our continued efforts to empower every employee with Microsoft 365. With capabilities for firstline workers now in Teams, every employee in your organization will be able to use Teams to streamline their workday, collaborate with coworkers, and access information and expertise to help them do their best work.

## Frequently asked questions

### When will StaffHub be retired?

Starting April 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will no longer be available for new tenants and all other points of access. Current users will still be able to use the service until October 1, 2019, however no additional features will be made available.

### What will happen once StaffHub is retired?

Microsoft StaffHub will stop functioning for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who attempts to open the app will be shown a message directing them to download Teams. If the user has an active license that includes Teams, their data and core functionality from StaffHub will be available to them upon their transition to Teams.
Between April 2019 and October 2019, StaffHub users will receive in-app notifications encouraging them to use Teams.

### What do I need to do to prepare for this change?

IT administrators of tenants with active Microsoft StaffHub users will be notified in the Office 365 Message Center on the actions they'll need to take to transition to the Shifts app in Teams. Information about how to migrate from StaffHub to Shifts in Teams, including tools to help with migration, will be available soon.

Your users will be informed about the app’s retirement through in-app notifications, but you may want to communicate the change to them as well, and update any internal documentation that refers to StaffHub.

Check back here for additional information on how to successfully transition from StaffHub to Shifts in Teams, including data migration, managing the new StaffHub capabilities we're building into Teams (in the Microsoft Teams admin center), and other information about actions required by admin and end users.

### Will Teams offer all the functionality currently offered in StaffHub?

Yes, starting November 2018, Teams will offer a Shifts feature, which enables managers to create, update, and manage schedules, and lets employees post their availability, swap shifts, and request time off. Additionally, the Home view in the Teams mobile app will display the employee’s schedule and important company announcements. 

To learn more, admins can go to [Manage the Shifts app for your organization in Teams](../../manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams.md). For end-user help on how to use Shifts in Teams, check out [Shifts Help for firstline workers and managers](https://support.office.com/article/apps-and-services-cc1fba57-9900-4634-8306-2360a40c665b). 

See the [roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=) for full details on additional features to be released in Teams.

### Why can't I access my StaffHub team from the Shifts app in Teams?

Teams that were created with Microsoft StaffHub can only be viewed and managed in StaffHub. When we release support to migrate your StaffHub team to Shifts in Teams, you'll be able to view StaffHub schedules in Shifts.

For more information, see [Understand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](../../teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md) and [Migration and interoperability guidance for organizations using Teams together with Skype for Business](../../migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype.md).

### Which devices or platforms is Shifts available on?

Shifts is available on the Teams web client, Teams desktop client, and Teams mobile clients (iOS and Android).

### How do I get Shifts?

If you're already on a plan that include Shifts, you can start using Shifts today as part of Teams. Getting started is easy. Firstline managers can sign in to Teams by using their Office 365 work account. From there, they can go to the Shifts app, either pinned to the app bar on the left side of Teams or by clicking **...** in the app bar to show more added apps. In Shifts, firstline managers can create and manage schedules for the teams that they are owner of and can invite firstline workers to download the app.  

### Where can I learn more about Shifts?
For product information, go to [https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/staff-scheduling-software](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/staff-scheduling-software). 

For admin guidance, go to **FOLLOWUP**.

### My organization is currently using StaffHub. What do I need to know to move firstline workers to Shifts in Teams?

Ensure that each user is covered with a Teams license from a qualified plan. For more information, see [Which plans are Shifts available in?](#which-plans-are-shifts-available-in).

### Do I need to train firstline workers again to use Shifts if they're already using and familiar with StaffHub?

No additional training is required. They can use Shifts in a similar way to how they used StaffHub.
 
### Does each firstline worker need to have an Office 365 account or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account?

Yes, each firstline worker and manager using Teams and Shifts within Teams must have an Office 365 account (Azure AD) and must be assigned a valid license.  
 
### Are there major differences between the Shifts iOS app and the Android app?

Core functionality is the same between the Shifts iOS and Android apps. There are minor UI differences between the two apps to align to their recommended design patterns.  
 
### Are there differences between the Shifts desktop and web app and the mobile (iOS and Android) apps?

For firstLine managers (team owners amd team managers), the desktop and web app is optimized to create teams, add members, build and publish schedules, and share content with the team. Team managers generally use the mobile app to approve requests,send quick messages to the team, call a firstline worker and collaborate on the go.  
 
For firstline workers (team members), there are differences in what can be done in the desktop and web app versus the mobile apps. We're working on feature parity. 
 
### What browsers do Shifts work on?

Shifts works on all the browsers that Teams supports which includes the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. For more information,see [Get clients for Teams](../../get-clients.md)
 
### What languages is Shifts available in?

Shifts is available in the following languages: Chinese-Simplified, English (U.S.), Spanish,Russian, Japanese, French, Brazilian-Portuguese, German, Korean, Italian, Chinese-Traditional, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian. We plan to add support for additional languages in the future.  

### Will team names be the same in Teams?

It’s possible that the name of a team will be different. Team names in Teams uses the  Office 365 Group name. If the StaffHub team name is different from the name of the corresponding Office 365 Group, you’ll see a different name when you switch over to Teams. 
 
### In StaffHub, I was able to add a special prefix to all Office 365 Groups that were created by StaffHub teams. Can I do the same in Teams?

You won't have the same capability when you move from StaffHub to Teams. If you need to apply name consistency to all your Office 365 Groups, you can use [Office 365 Groups naming policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/create-groups/groups-naming-policy).

EXTENSIBILITY & 3RD PARTIES FAQs [TO BE UPDATED] 
 
Is there an API? Is there an SDK available to integrate into existing systems, such as HR, payroll or Workforce Management systems?  
We have Graph API. These APIs will provide access to teams, members and shifts data, and can be used to integrate with HR, payroll or workforce management systems. 
 
Does StaffHub integrate with other workforce management or scheduling systems?  
We are investing in 3rd party integration and making it easy to connect to popular line of business applications. To start, we will support connections to Kronos, a leading provider of workforce management and human capital management cloud solutions. Initially, this integration will enable managers to import individual and team schedule information from Kronos directly into StaffHub. In addition to importing data into Microsoft StaffHub, users will have the ability to write schedule data back to Kronos, gain clock in/out functionality and manage accruals for employees. These capabilities will be in private preview with a small group of Office 365 and Kronos customers. Stay tuned for more information and timing.  
 
Are the APIs in Microsoft Graph? 
Not at this point in time, but we will make the APIs available in MS Graph in the future. 
 
[Aby] Will there be a Flow connector? 
Need to decide if we’ll be releasing one 
 
[Aby] Will there be powershell commandlets 
Eventually 
 
Can anyone use the Flow templates you’ve created? 
While anyone can use the pre-defined StaffHub flow templates, several of them are currently only optimized for the team manager and will not work well for employees. We are working on improvements that will come soon. Additionally, users will also need the correct licensing to create a Microsoft Flow and/or PowerApps. Users on Office 365 F1 have consumption rights only.   
 
[Aby] Flow won’t work for Teams. We need to decide if we’re doing a Flow connector for Teams 
 
How do I get code samples for your APIs? Is there a GitHub repository? 
Code samples are currently restricted to customers in our private preview. We are looking into the best options to share out these samples. 
 
[Aby]: We will be releasing them in a private preview 
 
What is the roadmap for your APIs? 
We do not have anything to announce at this point, but feedback from the private preview will greatly influence our future investments. 
 
You announced an integration with Dynamics 365. What happened with that? 
Our Dynamics 365 integration is still in the implementation phase. We do not have any timeline to announce at this time. 
[Aby] Don’t have this anymore 
 
Are the Microsoft StaffHub APIs free? 
Yes, the Microsoft StaffHub APIs are free. 
 
When are these features available? 
The APIs and Kronos integration are available right now in a private preview. Admin support for the APIs will come in later this calendar year. Connections between Microsoft Flow and StaffHub are available now in production on https://flow.microsoft.com.  
 
Will I need to recreate my conditional access policies for StaffHub? 
Once Shifts app is available in Microsoft Teams you can only apply conditional access policies at the Microsoft Teams app level.
