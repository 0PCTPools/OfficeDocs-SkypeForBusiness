# Microsoft StaffHub to be retired

Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. The Teams mobile app now includes shift management and a home screen experience. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out to Teams over time. 

These changes are part of our continued efforts to empower every employee with Microsoft 365. With capabilities for firstline workers now in Teams, every employee in your organization will be able to use Teams to streamline their workday, collaborate with coworkers, and access information and expertise to help them do their best work.

## Frequently asked questions

- **When will Microsoft StaffHub be retired?**<br> 
Starting April 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will no longer be available for new tenants and all other points of access. Current users will still be able to use the service until October 1, 2019, however no additional features will be made available.

- **What will happen once StaffHub is retired?**<br>
Microsoft StaffHub will stop functioning for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who attempts to open the app will be shown a message directing them to download Microsoft Teams. Provided the user has an active license that includes Teams, their data and the core functionality from StaffHub will be available to them upon their transition to Teams.
Between April 2019 and October 2019, StaffHub users will receive in-app notifications encouraging them to use Microsoft Teams.

- **What do I need to do to prepare for this change?**<br>
IT administrators of tenants with active Microsoft StaffHub users will be notified in the Office 365 Message Center on the actions they'll need to take to transition to the Shifts app in Teams. Information about how to migrate from StaffHub to Shifts in Teams, including tools to help with migration, will be available soon.

    Your users will be informed about the app’s retirement through in-app notifications, but you may want to communicate the change to them as well, and update any internal documentation that refers to Microsoft StaffHub.

    Please visit this page for additional information on how to successfully transition from StaffHub to Shifts in Teams, including data migration, managing the new StaffHub capabilities we're building into Teams (in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business admin center), and other information about actions required by administrators and end users.

- **Will Microsoft Teams offer all of the functionality currently offered in Microsoft StaffHub?**<br>  
Yes, starting in November 2018, Microsoft Teams will offer a Shifts feature, which enables managers to create, update, and manage schedules, and lets employees post their availability, swap shifts, and request time off. In addition, the Home view in the Teams mobile app will display the employee’s schedule and important company announcements. 

    To learn more, admins can go to [Manage the Shifts app for your organization in Teams](../../manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams.md). For end-user help on how to use Shifts in Teams, check out [Shifts Help for firstline workers and managers](https://support.office.com/article/apps-and-services-cc1fba57-9900-4634-8306-2360a40c665b). 

    See the [roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=) for full details on additional features to be released in Teams.

- **Why can't I access my StaffHub team from the Shifts app in Teams?**<br>

    Teams that were created with Microsoft StaffHub can only be viewed and managed in StaffHub. When we release support to migrate your StaffHub team to the Shifts app in Teams, you'll be able to view StaffHub schedules in Shifts.
