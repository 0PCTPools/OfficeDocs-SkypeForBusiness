# Microsoft StaffHub to be retired

Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. The Teams mobile app now includes shift management and a home screen experience. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out to Teams over time. 

These changes are part of our continued efforts to empower every employee with Microsoft 365. With capabilities for firstline workers now in Teams, every employee in your organization will be able to use Teams to streamline their workday, collaborate with coworkers, and access information and expertise to help them do their best work.

## Frequently asked questions

### About StaffHub retirement

#### When will StaffHub be retired?

Starting April 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will no longer be available for new tenants and all other points of access. Current users will still be able to use the service until October 1, 2019, however no additional features will be made available.

#### What will happen once StaffHub is retired?

Microsoft StaffHub will stop functioning for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who attempts to open the app will be shown a message directing them to download Teams. If the user has an active license that includes Teams, their data and core functionality from StaffHub will be available to them upon their transition to Teams.
Between April 2019 and October 2019, StaffHub users will receive in-app notifications encouraging them to use Teams.

#### Will Teams offer all the functionality currently offered in StaffHub?-FOLLOWUP

Yes, starting November 2018, Teams offers the Shifts app, which enables managers to create, update,and manage schedules, and lets employees post their availability, swap shifts, and request time off. Additionally, the Home view in the Teams mobile app displays the employee’s schedule and important company announcements.

See the [roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=) for full details on additional features to be released in Teams.

#### What do I need to do to prepare for this change?

Admins of tenants with active Microsoft StaffHub users will be notified in the Office 365 Message Center on the actions they'll need to take to transition to the Shifts app in Teams. Information about how to move from StaffHub to Shifts in Teams, including tools to help with the move, will be available soon.

Your users will be informed about the app’s retirement through in-app notifications, but you may want to communicate the change to them as well, and update any internal documentation that refers to StaffHub.

Check back here for additional information on how to successfully transition from StaffHub to Shifts in Teams, including data migration, managing the new StaffHub capabilities we're building into Teams (in the Microsoft Teams admin center), and other information about actions required by admin and users.

#### Why can't firstline workers in my organization access their StaffHub team from Shifts in Teams?

Teams that were created with Microsoft StaffHub can only be viewed and managed in StaffHub. When we release support to move your StaffHub team to Shifts in Teams, users will be able to view StaffHub schedules in Shifts.

### About Shifts

#### What is Shifts?

The Shifts app in Teams is a schedule management tool that keeps firstline managers and workers connected and in sync. Managers create, update, and manage shift schedules for teams, and firstline workers can view their schedules, see who else is scheduled for the day, request to swap or offer a shift, and request time off, all from their mobile devices.

#### Which plans is Shifts available in?

Shifts is available as part of Teams in the following plans without any additional cost:

- Office 365 Business Premium 
- Office 365 Enterprise F1, E1, E3, E5
- Office 365 for Education
- Microsoft 365 F1, E1, E3, E5

#### How do I get Shifts?

If you're already on a plan that includes Shifts, you can start using Shifts today as part of Teams. Getting started is easy. Firstline managers can sign in to Teams by using their Office 365 work account. From there, they can go to the Shifts app, either pinned to the app bar on the left side of Teams or by clicking **...** in the app bar. In Shifts, firstline managers can create and manage schedules for the teams that they are owner of and can invite firstline workers to download the app.

#### Which devices or platforms is Shifts available on?

Shifts is available on the Teams web client, Teams desktop client, and Teams mobile clients (iOS and Android).
 
#### Are there differences between the Shifts desktop and web app and the mobile (iOS and Android) apps?

For firstLine managers, the desktop and web app is optimized to create teams, add members, build and publish schedules, and share content with the team. Managers generally use the mobile app to approve requests, send quick messages to the team, call a firstline worker and collaborate on the go. 

For firstline workers, there are differences in what can be done in the desktop and web app versus the mobile apps. We're working on feature parity.

#### Are there differences between the Shifts iOS app and the Android app?

Core functionality is the same between the Shifts iOS and Android apps. There are minor UI differences between the two apps to align to their recommended design patterns.

#### What browsers does Shifts work on?

Shifts works on all the browsers that Teams supports which includes the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. For more information, see [Get clients for Teams](../../get-clients.md).
 
#### What languages does Shifts support?

Shifts is available in the following languages: Chinese-Simplified, English (U.S.), Spanish,Russian, Japanese, French, Brazilian-Portuguese, German, Korean, Italian, Chinese-Traditional, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian. We plan to add support for additional languages in the future.
