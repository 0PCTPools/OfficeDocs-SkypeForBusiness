# Move your StaffHub teams to Shifts in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out to Teams over time. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](https://support.office.com/article/microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired-30ca17f3-5502-4bc9-bb0a-bed04bb362f0).  

## Overview of Shifts
The Shifts app in Microsoft Teams keeps firstline workers connected and in sync. It's built mobile first for fast and effective time management and communication for teams. Shifts lets firstline workers and their managers use their mobile devices to manage schedules and keep in touch. 

- Managers create, update, and manage shift schedules for teams. They can send messages to one person ("there's a spill on the floor") or the entire team ("the regional GM is arriving in 20 minutes"). They can also send policy documents, news bulletins, and videos. 
- Employees view their upcoming shifts, can see who else is scheduled for the day, request to swap or offer a shift, and request time off. 

It's important to know that Shifts currently doesn't support guest users. This means that guests on a team can't be added to or use shift schedules when Guest access is turned on in Teams.
