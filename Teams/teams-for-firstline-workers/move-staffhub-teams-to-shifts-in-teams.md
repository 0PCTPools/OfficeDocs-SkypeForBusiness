# Move your Microsoft StaffHub teams to Shifts in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We’re building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out over time. StaffHub will stop functioning for all users on October 1, 2019. Users who try to open it will be shown a message directing them to download Teams.  

With the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams, managers in your organization can create and manage schedules and team members can view their upcoming shifts, set availability, request to swap or offer a shift, and request time off, all from their mobile devices.  

This article walks you through how to move your organization’s StaffHub teams and schedule data to Shifts in Teams. Whether you’re a small business with one or two StaffHub teams or a large enterprise with hundreds of StaffHub teams, here you’ll find the guidance you need to help make your transition to Teams successful.

## Prepare

### Assign Teams licenses

StaffHub users in your organization must have a Teams license, which enables them on Teams. Shifts is available in all Office 365 subscriptions that include Teams with the exceptions of US Government Cloud Community (GCC) and Teams free.

You manage Teams licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center. To learn more, see [Office 365 licensing for Teams](../Office-365-licensing.md) and [Manage user access to Teams](../user-access.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization uses Skype for Business and you’re not ready to move all your users to Teams, you can have firstline workers run Teams alongside Skype for Business. In this coexistence mode, called *Islands*, each client app operates as a separate solution. To learn more, see [Understand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](../teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md).

### Provision accounts for StaffHub users who don't have an identity in Azure AD

StaffHub users must have an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). If StaffHub users don't already have an identity in Azure AD, provision an account for them.
