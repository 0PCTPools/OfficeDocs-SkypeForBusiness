# Assign policies to your users in Microsoft Teams

As an admin, you use policies to control how users in your organization use Microsoft Teams to communicate and collaborate. For example, you can set app policies to control what apps are available to Teams users, meeting policies to define the meeting experience, and messaging policies to control what chat and channel features are available to users.

You can use the built-in global (Org-wide default) policy or create custom policies and assign them to users. Users in your organization will automatically get the global policy unless you create and assign a custom policy.

If you want to customize Teams for different groups of users in your organization, create and assign one or more custom policies. If a user is assigned a custom policy, that policy applies to the user. If a user isn't assigned a custom policy, the global policy applies to the user.

You can use the Microsoft Teams admin center to assign a policy to users or [Teams PowerShell module](teams-powershell-overview.md) cmdlets to assign a policy to multiple users at a time or to users in a group, such as a security group.

## Using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Users**, and then click the user.
2. Select the user by clicking to the left of the user name, and then click **Edit settings**.
3. Select the policy you want to assign, and then click **Apply**.

To assign a policy to multiple users at a time, see [Edit Teams user settings in bulk](edit-user-settings-in-bulk.md).

Or, you can also do the following:

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to the policy page.
2. Select the policy you want to assign by clicking to the left of the policy name.
3. Select **Manage users**.
4. In the **Manage users** pane, search for the user by display name or by user name, select the name, and then select **Add**. Repeat this step for each user that you want to add.
5. When you're finished adding users, select **Save**.

## Using PowerShell

### Assign a custom policy to a batch of users
 
Use the [New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/teams/new-csbatchpolicyassignmentoperation) cmdlet to assign a policy to multiple users at a time. With batch policy assignment, you don't have to write a script. You submit a batch of users and the policy that you want to assign to them. The assignments are processed as a background operation and an operation Id is generated for each batch, which allows you to track the progress and status of the assignments. 

You can specify users by their object Id, UPN, SIP, or email address. A batch can contain up to 20,000 users. 

In this example, we assign an app setup policy named HR App Setup Policy to a batch of users who are listed in a Users_ids.text file.

```
$user_ids = Get-Content .\users_ids.txt
New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation -PolicyType TeamsAppSetupPolicy -PolicyName "HR App Setup Policy" -Identity $users_ids -OperationName "Example 1 batch"
```

See also Get-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation and Set-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation. 

### Assign a custom app setup policy to users in a group

You may want to assign a custom app setup policy to multiple users that youâ€™ve already identified. For example, you may want to assign a policy to all users in a security group. You can do this by connecting to the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module and the Skype for Business PowerShell module. For more information about using PowerShell to manage Teams, see [Teams PowerShell Overview](teams-powershell-overview.md).

In this example, we assign a custom app setup policy called HR App Setup Policy to all users in the Contoso Pharmaceuticals HR Project group.  

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you first connect to the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module and Skype for Business PowerShell module by following the steps in [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/powershell/connect-to-all-office-365-services-in-a-single-windows-powershell-window).

Get the GroupObjectId of the particular group.
```
$group = Get-AzureADGroup -SearchString "Contoso Pharmaceuticals HR Project"
```
Get the members of the specified group.
```
$members = Get-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $group.ObjectId -All $true | Where-Object {$_.ObjectType -eq "User"}
```
Assign all users in the group to a particular app setup policy. In this example, it's HR App Setup Policy.
```
$members | ForEach-Object { Grant-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy -PolicyName "HR App Setup Policy" -Identity $_.EmailAddress}
``` 
Depending on the number of members in the group, this command may take several minutes to execute.
