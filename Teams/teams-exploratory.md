Manage the Microsoft Teams Exploratory license
=======================================================

## Who's eligible?

Users must be enabled to sign up for apps and trials (in the Microsoft 365 admin center). For more information, see [Manage the offer](#manage-the-offer), later in this article. 

Users who don't have an Office 365 license that includes Teams can initiate Teams Exploratory. For example, if a user has Office 365 Business (which doesn't include Teams), they're eligible for Teams Exploratory.

## Who isn't eligible

Your organization isn't eligible for this offer if you're a Syndication Partner Customer or a GCC, GCC High, DoD, or EDU customer.


## How users sign up for Teams Exploratory

Eligible users can sign up for Teams Exploratory by directly signing in to Teams ([teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com)). They will be assigned this license automatically and the tenant admin will receive an email notification the first time someone in your org starts Teams Exploratory.

## Manage Teams Exploratory

Teams Exploratory is meant to be initiated by individual end users, and you may not initiate this offer on behalf of end-user employees.

Teams Exploratory comes with an Exchange Online license but it won't be assigned to the user until the admin assigns it. If the user doesn't have an Exchange license already and the admin has yet to assign the Exchange Online license, the user won't be able to schedule meetings in Teams and may be missing other Teams functionality.

Admins can disable the ability for end users to run Teams Exploratory within their organization by using the **Trial apps and services** switch.


### Prevent users from installing trial apps and services

You can turn off a userâ€™s ability to install trial apps and services, would prevent the user from running Teams Exploratory.

1. From the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home), go to **Settings** > **Services & add-ins** > **User owned Apps and Services**.

2. Turn off **Let users install trial apps and services**.

    ![Screenshot of the User owned Apps & Services page in admin center](media/iw-trial-enable-2.png)
> [!NOTE]
> If your organization is ineligible for Teams Exploratory, you won't see the **Let users install trial apps and services** switch.

### Manage availability for a user with a license that includes Teams

A user who is assigned a license that includes Teams isn't eligible for Teams Exploratory. When the Teams service plan is turned on, the user can sign in and use Teams. If the service plan is disabled, the user can't sign in and Teams Exploratory isn't available.

To turn off access to Teams:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users** > **Active users**.

2. Select the box next to the name of the user.

3. On the right, in the **Product licenses** row, choose **Edit**.

4. In the **Product licenses** pane, switch the toggle to **Off**.

### Manage Teams availability for users who are already using Teams Exploratory

If a user is running Teams Exploratory, you can turn it off by removing the license or service plan.

To turn off the Teams Exploratory license:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users** > **Active users**.

2. Select the box next to the name of the user.

3. On the right, in the **Product licenses** row, choose **Edit**.

4. In the **Product licenses** pane, switch the toggle for this exploratory license to **Off**.

    
>[!Note]
>The Teams Exploratory toggle switch will appear after the first user in the organization launches Teams Exploratory.

### Manage Teams for users who have the exploratory license

You can manage users who have the exploratory license just like you manage users who have a regular paid license. For more information, see [Manage Microsoft Teams settings for your organization](enable-features-office-365.md).

### Upgrade users from the exploratory license

To upgrade users from the exploratory license, do the following:

1. Purchase a subscription that includes Teams.

2. Remove the Teams Exploratory subscription from the user.

3. Assign the newly purchased license.

For more information, see [Office 365 licensing for Microsoft Teams](Office-365-licensing.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If the Teams Exploratory license ends and a user is not immediately upgraded to a subscription that includes Teams, the user data is not removed. The user still exists in Azure Active Directory and all data within Teams still remains. Once a new license is assigned to the user to enable Teams functionality again, all content will still exist. 

## What happens to legacy Microsoft Teams Commercial Cloud Trial licenses?

As of mid January, 2020, eligible users can begin claiming the latest Microsoft Teams Exploratory Experience license. All legacy Teams Commercial Cloud Trial licenses will be automatically converted to the new offer before their trial expires.
