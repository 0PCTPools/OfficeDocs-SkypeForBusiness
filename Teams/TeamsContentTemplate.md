Article template - Microsoft Teams Admin content
================================================

Use this template as a starting point for your Teams Admin article. If you need to create something that's not here, tell LolaJ and she'll add it to the template. 

## Metadata guidance

Here are the metadata attributes that appear at the top of every article. Please add the correct value for each attribute.

| Attribute | Value |
|---------|---------|
| title: Article title goes here |  This is what shows up at the top of the article and in search results. A good title helps the reader decide whether your article contains the information they need.  |   
| author: LolaJacobsen |This is your GitHub user name |
| ms.author: lolaj  | This is your Microsoft alias |
| manager: serdars  | Please don't change this value - Serdar owns the all-up content set |
| ms.date: 08/10/2017  | This is the last published date |
| ms.topic: solution  | Choices: article, business-process, conceptual, contributor-guide, get-started-article, hero-article, hub-page, interactive-tutorial, landing-page, non-content, overview, quickstart, reference, sample, search, solution, tutorial, troubleshooting |
| ms.prod: Teams | For Teams articles, don't change this value! |
| description: Describe the main intent of the article. | This description shows up in internet search results and impacts SEO. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't delete any metadata from the header of your article! If you don't know what to enter for an attribute, ask LolaJ.

## Office voice guidelines

Use the [Office Voice guidelines](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2665&topicid=29059) for writing style (including voice & tone), word choice, article organization, keywording for SEO, and so much more.

Check out the [Office Style Guide](http://aka.ms/OfficeStyleGuide) for the nitty gritty.

## Basic formatting     

To format text, use this mark up: 

**For bold, enclose the text in 2 asterisks**. 

\* If you want to use an asterisk as a character, preceed it with a \ character.

\*\* Same thing for 2 asterisks...

For italics, *enclose the text in 1 asterisk*.

# This is a Level 1 Heading

## This is a Level 2 Heading - it shows up in the **In this article** list in the right rail

> [!TIP]
> Use heading formatting to create hierarchy in articles. On docs.microsoft.com, level-2 headings automatically show up in an **In this article** section in the right rail, so you can use level-2 headings to automatically create navigation for your article.

### This is a Level 3 Heading 

###### Heading Level 6 is as deep as you can go

- Bulleted lists look like this
    - item 1 (TAB to indent one level)
    - item 2

1. Numbered lists look like this
    2. item 1 (again, TAB to indent one level)    
    2. item 2

For a full list of all Markdown formatting & styles, see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). (By the way, this is what a link looks like. Use the **Link** button in Gauntlet to create internal or external links; you can also create links to a bookmark in this file or in other files.)

## Tables

Tables are easy to create, but they definitely have some limitations. Best practice: Keep your tables simple. No merged cells, no nesting. 

|Column 1 heading  |Column 2 heading  |Column 3 heading  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Create team     |Yes        |No         |
|Leave team     |Yes         |Yes         |
|Edit team name/description      |Yes         |No         |
|Delete team      |Yes         |No         |

## Adding images and screen caps

Use these guidelines for images and screen caps.

## Embedding videos

Embedding videos is relatively straightforward. Just click the **Insert media** button in the Gauntlet toolbar, enter the URL for the video, and you're done!

For example: 

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7yDOfkpG48]


If you want to embed a video in a table, here's how you do it:

|  |  |
|---------|---------|
|<iframe width="350" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oej3xIQy-Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>     |<iframe width="350" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7yDOfkpG48" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>      |


> [!NOTE]
> Here's a note. Highlight the note text, then click the **Alert** button in the Gauntlet toolbar. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Get some exercise every day, and be sure to drink plenty of water.

> [!WARNING]
> Never run with scissors

> [!TIP]
> Tipping is always appreciated by your wait staff.
