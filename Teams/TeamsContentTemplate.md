## Office voice guidelines

Use the [Office Voice guidelines](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2665&topicid=29059) for writing style (including voice & tone), word choice, article organization, keywording for SEO, and so much more!

Check out the [Office Style Guide](http://aka.ms/OfficeStyleGuide) for the nitty gritty.

## Basic formatting     

To format text, use this mark up: **For bold, enclose the text in 2 asterisks***. For italics, *enclose the text in 1 asterisk*.

Use heading formatting to create hierarchy in articles. On docs.microsoft.com, level-2 headings automatically show up in an **In this article** section in the right rail, so you can use level-2 headings to automatically create navigation for your article.

# This is a Heading Level 1

## This is a Heading Level 2

### This is a Heading Level 3

###### Heading Level 6 is as deep as you can go

For a full list of all Markdown formatting & styles, see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). (By the way, this is what a link looks like. Use the Link button in Gauntlet to create internal or external links; you can also create links to a bookmark in this file or in other files.)

- Bulleted lists look like this
    - item 1 (TAB to indent one level)
    - item 2

1. Numbered lists look like this
    2. item 1 (again, TAB to indent one level)    
    2. item 2

Tables are easy to create, but they definitely have some limitations. Best practice: Keep your tables simple. No merged cells, no nesting. 

|Column 1 heading  |Column 2 heading  |Column 3 heading  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Create team**     |Yes        |No         |
|**Leave team**     |Yes         |Yes         |
|**Edit team name/description**      |Yes         |No         |
|**Delete team**      |Yes         |No         |
\* If you want to use a plain ol' asterisk, preceed it with a \ character.

\*\*Same thing for 2 asterisks...
