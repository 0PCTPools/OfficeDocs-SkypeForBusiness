This article is part of the Technical Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the User Readiness stage. 

# Prepare my environment

To drive a successful Teams migration within your organization, it's quite important to validate your current Skype for Business environment and your network readiness. Taking time to plan the individual steps you need to take on each location you have can help accelerate your deployment with no important action items left behind.

These activities should be completed in parallel with your user readiness preparation:

- [Performing an environmental discovery](upgrade-prepare-environment-discover-environment.md): This includes a sample questionnaire to confirm your organizations readiness for the successful migration to Teams.
- [Preparing your network](upgrade-prepare-environment-prepare-network.md): Planning, preparation and remediation steps for your network to support Teams workloads.
- [Preparing for rollout](upgrade-prepare-environment-prepare-service.md): Onboarding checklists to ensure your Teams configuration is ready to support migration of your users from Skype for Business to Teams.
