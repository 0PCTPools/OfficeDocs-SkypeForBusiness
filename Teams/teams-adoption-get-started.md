# Get started driving adoption of Microsoft Teams

By driving adoption of Microsoft Teams, you can deliver an excellent user experience and increased business value inside your company. Our goal is to get you up and running quickly so that you can begin your journey with Microsoft Teams. This guide focuses on user adoption of Microsoft Teams and has dependencies on your environment’s technical readiness, which is addressed in other sections of our documentation.

## Adoption prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure that:

- [Teams is enabled](quick-start-enable-teams.md) and licenses are assigned in your environment. At a minimum licenses should be assigned to your core team and early adopters who will participate in this initial project phase.

- You have downloaded the desktop and mobile applications. 

## Office 365 adoption framework

Office 365 has an adoption framework that applies to major workloads in the service. This framework addresses the core steps that any organization should take to enable cloud services. You can learn more about the overall adoption framework [here](https://aka.ms/O365AdoptionHub). 

In this Teams adoption plan, we have organized the steps in phases and are providing specific Teams guidance as outlined in the overview, below.

## Overview of phases for Teams adoption 

Every adoption project varies in size and complexity based on your environment, but the initial steps are identical across the board. We believe that breaking the process down into three distinct phases &#x2014 Startup, Experiment, and Enable &#x2014 will streamline adoption for everyone.  

- **Startup** - In this first phase, you will gather your team together, set up your initial teams, and use Teams to begin planning Teams adoption. This approach will increase your technical familiarity with the product and help you to build the skills necessary to successfully complete subsequent phases. 

- **Experiment** - In this phase of controlled growth, you will bring your internal champions and early adopters onboard. You will speak with your business users to identify scenarios that would immediately benefit from the collaboration and communications capabilities that Teams provides. You will gather feedback that will inform your broad-scale adoption phase, and you will make service decisions about governance and lifecycle management that will ensure a successful deployment.

- **Enable** - This is the broad-scale deployment phase in which you will enable Teams capabilities for all your employees. In this phase, the size of your organization will determine whether this is a “go big” project that will enable all employees simultaneously or if you will approach this by region, business unit, or other method of segmenting your employee population. In this phase you will move to a continuous delivery model. Employees, leaders, and business units will want to expand their use of Teams and will require training and your engagement to understand how to best use Teams and other features of Office 365.   

Each of these adoption phases depends on the technical readiness workstream and your environment's readiness for Teams. Let's get started!
