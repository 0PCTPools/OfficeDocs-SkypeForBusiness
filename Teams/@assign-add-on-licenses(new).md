# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams features. They give you the flexibility to add features only for users in your organization who need them. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Depending on the plan you already have, you can buy add-on licenses for the following Microsoft Teams features.

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Feature** <br/> |**Description** <br/> |
|**Audio Conferencing** <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Teams meeting instead of using their computer. Use the Audio Conferencing feature for these scenarios.  <br/> To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). <br/> For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762).  <br/> |
|**Toll free numbers for dial-in access to your conferences, and the ability to dial out from a conference to add someone by calling any telephone number in the world** <br/> |If you add Audio Conferencing, we recommend that you [Set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). <br/> |
|**Phone System** <br/> |A PBX is a telephone system in a business. Phone System in Office 365 is a hosted telephone service. It gives you both traditional and innovative PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment. [Here's what you get with Phone System in Office 365](../here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md).  <br/> For pricing info, see [Pricing for Phone System](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=79976).  <br/> |
|**Calling Plans** <br/> |Calls to other Teams users are free, but if you want your users to be able to call any phone numbers outside of your business, get a [Calling Plan](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md). There are Domestic Calling Plans and Domestic and International Calling Plans in Office 365.  <br/> For pricing info, see [Pricing for Calling Plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799761 ).  <br/> |
|**Microsoft Teams Rooms** <br/> |This isn't an add-on, but a feature that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. See [Microsoft Teams Rooms](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/license-options-based-on-your-plan/skype-room-systems-v2).  <br/> |

If you want cloud voicemail........then..........???

For most organizations, buying a bundle of software in an Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with a higher combined cost.

### How do I use my existing Calling Plans with Teams?
<a name="bkmk_existing"></a>

If you're using on-premises PSTN connectivity for hybrid users, you *only* assign **Phone System** licenses to your users. **DO NOT** also assign a Calling Plan.

???For Phone System Direct Routing, see [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md#licensing-and-other-requirements).

## Assign add-on licenses

After you decide on which features you want for your Teams users, assign the licenses to them.

### For small and medium businesses (less than 300 users)

Procedure for M365 SMB plans. Go to MAC > Active Users > choose a user > licenses > pick Business Voice.

<Screenshot of licensing>

### If you're a large business or enterprise (more than 300 users)

Procedure for Enterprise or large businesses. Go to MAC > Active Users > choose a user > licenses > pick which features you want.

### Assign add-on licenses in bulk

You can use WIndows PowerShell to assign multiple users a license for Business Voice, Phone System , Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans.
