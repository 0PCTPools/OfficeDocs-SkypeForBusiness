# Microsoft Teams adoption phase 1 - startup

Initiating your adoption of Microsoft Teams starts with the following activities:

1.	Validate adoption [prerequisites](teams-adoption-get-started.md).
2.	Assemble your team.
3.	Understand teams and channels.
4.	Set up your first teams on Teams.
5.	Build your technical knowledge.
6.	Assess your organization's readiness for change.

The primary goal of this phase is to ensure your readiness for the experimentation phase. You will also determine if you need assistance from Microsoft or from our network of skilled partners.  

## Validate adoption prerequisites

Review our [prerequisites](teams-adoption-get-started.md) and work with the technical team to meet them if necessary. We will not address deeper technical requirements at this time.

## Assemble your team

The table below lists the core roles for your project team. In a smaller organization, some of these roles may be carried out by the same person. Note those that we’ve identified as essential to your success.

| Role | Responsibilities | Department |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Executive Sponsor | Communicate high-level vision. Connect Microsoft Teams implementation to core mission and priority initiatives at the company. | Executive Leadership |
| Success Owner | Ensure the business goals are realized from the Microsoft Teams rollout. | Any department |
| Program Manager | Oversee the entire Microsoft Teams launch execution and rollout process. | IT |
| Champions | Help evangelize Microsoft Teams, support skill building, and provide usage insights. | Multiple departments |
| Training Lead | Manage and communicate training content about Microsoft Teams. | IT or other |
| Department Leads (Stakeholders) | Identify how specific departments will use Microsoft Teams and encourage engagement. | Any department (management) |
| IT Specialists | Oversee all technical aspects of implementation, including integrations. | IT |
| Communication Lead | Oversee company-wide communications about Microsoft Teams. | Corporate Communications, IT, or other |
| Community Manager | Manage day-to-day Yammer network activity. Provide guidance and best practices. | Multiple departments |

In most cases, this initial team should be a small group of like-minded individuals who are interested in Microsoft Teams and may also be accountable for its implementation. As your adoption plan moves on to additional phases, you will include more people in your team. We also suggest that you take advantage of the Microsoft resources that are available to assist you. 

### Additional resources

The [Microsoft Technical Community](https://aka.ms/TechCommunity) delivers peer-provided insights into adoption and technical issues for many Office 365 products. We suggest that you join the following communities:

- [Microsoft Teams Technical Community](https://aka.ms/TeamsCommunity) – Get product questions answered, learn from other Microsoft Teams customers, and follow our blog to stay up to date on new features and use cases for Microsoft Teams. 
- [Office 365 Champions Program](https://aka.ms/O365Champions) and the Driving Adoption community – Learn from your peers about how to best drive adoption of Office 365 workloads such as Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Yammer, and other products. Open to IT Pros, business users, the “accidental” developer, and anyone interested in driving adoption of cloud services.  

[Custom Learning for Office 365](https://aka.ms/CLO365) includes a SharePoint Online template and custom webpart that you can use to create a training portal for your organization. This free, open source solution lets you stream Microsoft training assets directly into your Office 365 tenant. You can customize it for the services you are using and add additional training content to the site experience. If you already have a SharePoint Online training portal, you can download just the webpart to install directly on your company’s site, and then configure it based on your implementation requirements.
