## Use Power BI to analyze CQD data for Microsoft Teams

New in January 2020: [Download Power BI query templates for CQD](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SkypeForBusiness/blob/live/Teams/downloads/CQD-Power-BI-query-templates.zip?raw=true). Customizable Power BI templates you can use to analyze and report your CQD data.

For CQD reports in Teams, if you’d rather use Power BI to query and report your data, download our CQD Power BI templates. When you open the templates in Power BI, you’ll be prompted to sign in with your CQD admin credentials. You can customize these query templates and distribute them to anyone in your organization who has a Power BI license and CQD admin permissions.

Before you can use these PBIX files, you’ll need to install the Power BI Connector for Microsoft Advanced CQD (MicrosoftCallQuality.pqx). See the “Power BI Connector for Microsoft Teams CQD.docx” file to learn how to install this PQX file.
