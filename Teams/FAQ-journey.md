UC Vision
---------

### What is Microsoft’s new vision for Intelligent Communications (aka Unified Communications vision)? 

We’ve enjoyed great success across Office 365 with over 100M monthly commercial active users counting on Office 365 every day to get their work done. We are now bringing the capabilities of Skype for Business in the cloud into Microsoft Teams to deliver a single hub for teamwork, with built-in, fully integrated voice and video. Tightly weaving communications into the apps teams use to collaborate every day, alongside AI, Microsoft Graph, LinkedIn, and other data and cognitive services, we will enable Intelligent Communications, revolutionizing calling and meeting experiences.

### Why did you decide to bring Skype for Business and Teams together? 

As users are working on more teams, we see the opportunity to more seamlessly integrate our communication capabilities into Microsoft Teams so users can have a single place for their conversations, contacts and content. We believe Microsoft Teams also provides a modern cloud infrastructure that enables us to take advantage of our assets for artificial intelligence such as AI, Microsoft Graph, LinkedIn to deliver intelligent communications. With Microsoft Teams, we can create new experiences for meetings and calling including the prep, delivery and post follow-ups.

### Is there a firm deadline by which customers need to move from Skype for Business Online to Teams? 

We will make our roadmap for Microsoft Teams available, so customers can assess the capabilities for Teams relative to their needs and plan their move to Teams. Customers can determine the timing for moving to Team that best meets their needs.

### What will happen to Skype for Business on-premises? 

We will continue to offer Skype for Business Server on-premises for customers who are not ready to move all their users to the cloud. We are currently in planning for the next release of Skype for Business Server and we are ***targeting*** a release at the end of CY2018 (dates subject to change).

OCS 2007 Server and OCS 2007 R2 Server are both reaching end of life in January 2018. This is in alignment with the typical Microsoft support lifecycle and not related to the current roadmap changes.

### What will happen to the Skype brand? 

We remain committed to the Skype brand which represents a family of communications capabilities across our consumer and commercial segments. Skype remains the brand for our consumer offer and Skype for Business remains as the product name for the on-premises server. The Skype for Business brand will also surface as an icon in voice and video experiences within Microsoft Teams.

### What does this mean from a licensing perspective? How will customers pay for UC Services in Teams?

Microsoft Teams is available in the Office 365 suites. Capabilities that are premium workloads in Skype for Business in Office 365 today will continue to be premium workloads in Microsoft Teams. Existing licensing investments made by customers will carry forward to Microsoft Teams. For example, if a customer has purchased Audio Conferencing standalone or E5 with Skype for Business, Audio Conferencing will be enabled in Microsoft Teams as it is available today.

### Is Microsoft planning scheduled upgrades? 

Currently, we have no plans to schedule upgrades for enterprise customers. Customers can choose to move to Microsoft Teams as the capabilities meet their business needs. We will empower administrators and users with tools and guidance to assist them in the transition to Microsoft Teams.

### What does this mean for existing Office 365 customers?

We will bring the full set of Skype for Business capabilities in Office 365 into Teams over time along with new voice, video and meetings innovation. Customers may choose to migrate Skype for Business users when the capabilities meet their requirements. We encourage all Office 365 customers to start using Teams independently or side-by-side with Skype for Business.

### What do you recommend for customers who are currently in the process or planning to deploy Skype for Business? 

Customers should evaluate the Teams roadmap to determine if capabilities will meet business needs and timing requirements. If so, they should adjust strategy to deploy Teams. Planning and infrastructure investments such as network assessments will accrue to Teams deployment. If not, customers should move forward with Skype for Business. We encourage all Office 365 customers to start using Teams, independently or in parallel with Skype for Business.

### What support are you offering to customers who wish to move to Teams, especially those who have made significant investments in Skype for Business in Office 365? 

Customers continue to use Skype for Business in Office 365 until Microsoft Teams meets their business needs. We will assist customers who wish to move users to Teams with tools and guidance to control and manage the process. We will help ease the transition for users new to Microsoft Teams with a specialized first run experience and in-product coach marks. It will have controls to trim capabilities available in the client to communications – keeping the features more familiar until they are ready for the richer set of Teams capabilities. FastTrack, customer support and partners will be available to help guide customers through the transition

### How will Microsoft approach the upgrade from Skype for Business in Office 365 to Microsoft Teams? 

We will assist customers who wish to migrate users to Teams with tools and guidance to control and manage the process. We will help ease the transition for users new to Microsoft Teams with a specialized first run experience and in-product coach marks. IT will have controls to trim capabilities available in the client – keeping the features more familiar until they are ready for the richer set of Teams capabilities. FastTrack, CSS and partners will be available to help support customers through the transition.

### What does our new vision mean for partners?

Our new vision for bringing together Intelligent Communications with collaboration as part of Microsoft Teams offers new opportunities for partners. System integrators will be able to support customers as they assess Microsoft Teams for their future communications needs, as well as continue to deploy customers on Skype for Business online or on-premises. Independent software vendors will be able to build new solutions on Microsoft Teams as new APIs and SDKs are available.

Roadmap
-------

### How can customers learn when Skype for Business capabilities will be available in Microsoft Teams?

Going forward, we will make our roadmap available, so customers can assess Microsoft Teams for their communication needs.

### How does this change the roadmap for Skype for Business in Office 365? 

Our vision for bringing together Intelligent Communications and collaboration is focused on Microsoft Teams. We will continue to support Skype for Business in Office 365.

### Will you continue to invest in improving Skype for Business in Office 365? 

Our vision for bringing together Intelligent Communications and collaboration is focused on Microsoft Teams. We will continue to support Skype for Business in Office 365.

### When will Teams be at parity with what is currently offered in Skype for Business? 

To achieve our vision, we will bring the Skype for Business capabilities into Teams. Customers can expect the core capabilities for messaging and chat in H1 CY2018 and meetings and voice in H2 CY2018 (dates subject to change). We will make our roadmap available, so customers can assess when Microsoft Teams meets their needs.

### When will you deliver Teams/SfB interoperability?

At Ignite, we will announce capabilities to support users on the Teams client and users on the Skype for Business client to work together more seamlessly. These features include universal presence across Office 365, federated chat and calling, and that ability to include people outside the organization. Future interop investments will be published to the Teams roadmap.

### Is there a point at which Skype for Business will no longer be included in new Office 365 subscriptions? 

We will continue to support the Skype for Business service and client. We have no plan to remove Skype for Business from Office 365 subscriptions at this time.

### Do you have plans to offer Teams in the Office 365 US Government Community Cloud (GCC and DoD)? 

Microsoft Teams is actively pursuing FedRAMP compliance and is targeting a GCC offering in CY2018 (dates subject to change). Today, customers can continue to deploy Skype for Business in Office 365.

### Do you have plans to offer Microsoft Teams in the Microsoft Cloud Deutschland (MCD)? 

Yes. More information will be available at a future time.

### Do you have plans to offer Microsoft Teams in GoLocal clouds? 

Microsoft currently supports storing customer data in region (Americas, EMEA, and APAC) based on the tenant affinity. This also meets the EU model clause requirements. For customers who require GoLocal support, where data remains in country (not just in region), Microsoft Teams is actively pursuing this, and more information will be available at a future time.

Skype for Business Server 
--------------------------

### What is the future of Skype for Business Server?

We recognize that customers are using Skype for Business on-premises and many need to use Skype for Business on-premises for some users or geographies due to their requirements. We are targeting the next version of the Skype for Business Server on-premises with a new set of server updates by end of CY2018 (dates subject to change).

### What is the plan for the existing Windows, Mac, and Mobile clients for on-premises customers?

We will continue to support the Skype for Business clients for on-premises and online customers.

### Are we continuing support for VDI users connecting to on-premises servers?

Yes. Our strategy for on-premises users remains the same – our partners are providing software that works with the Skype for Business Windows client for VDI users who are connecting to an on-premises server.

Voice and Audio Devices
-----------------------

### What is the plan for Microsoft’s online voice capabilities?

We will be adding our currently available Cloud PBX and voice capabilities to Microsoft Teams, as well as additional capabilities which had been part of the Skype for Business in Office 365 roadmap and futures discussions.  This will happen over time with key functionality slated for delivery during H2 CY18 (dates subject to change).

### Is Teams meeting and call quality as good as or better than Skype for Business? 

Quality and reliability is critical to an enterprise communications cloud. A new, built-for-the cloud, highly scalable microservices architecture is more efficient in bandwidth consumption, provides more robust telemetry and enables maintenance and upgrades with minimal disruption. End users will see faster meeting join times and a browser experience that no longer requires a plug-in download. This modern infrastructure will enable meetings to use Office 365 cognitive services like transcription, speech recognition and machine learning to light up new scenarios and value. For the client, one platform delivers both Windows and MAC client experiences.

### How will you know if meeting and calling quality is better in Microsoft than Skype for Business?

We continue to invest in telemetry for our communications cloud to be able to measure and proactively manage quality and reliability. Customers will also be able to monitor and proactively manage their environments with investments such as the Call Quality Dashboard and Call Analytics.

### What is the guidance for customers already deployed on Cloud PBX to the Teams platform?

Customers should evaluate the Teams roadmap to determine when capabilities will meet their business needs. We encourage all Office 365 customers to start using Teams, independently or in parallel with Skype for Business.

### Can customers use existing devices (such as IP phones) that currently work with Skype for Business in Office 365 with Teams?

Yes, we will enable customers to leverage existing investments in USB & IP phone hardware with Teams.

### Is there any update to the roadmap for Calling Plans (formerly known as PSTN Calling)?

We plan to bring the countries currently in Preview (Germany and Belgium) to general availability as well as we are targeting expansion to Australia and Canada. We will make our roadmap available, so customers can assess our Calling Plan coverage for their business needs.

### How will Polycom Group Series devices be supported?

Polycom is investigating the ability for Group Series endpoints to register to Teams natively and join Teams meetings. In the meantime, existing Group Series will continue to support registration and meeting joins for Skype for Business Online and Skype for Business server.

Hybrid Voice
------------

### Will hybrid voice be supported with Microsoft Teams?

We plan to support hybrid voice scenarios in Teams including the option for customers to connect their own PSTN trunks. we also have received good feedback about the need to reduce cost and complexity of deployment of the on-premises components. Based on this feedback, we are planning on how to deliver a simpler approach.

Customers that deployed CCE or connected own trunks via on-premises pools (OPCH) will have a clear migration path from the current to the new architecture and interoperability story.

### When will hybrid customers be able to move to Teams?

We are planning to simplify how customers connect trunks or 3<sup>rd</sup> party telephony systems to Office 365 based on customer feedback. The new approach is currently targeted for availability in Microsoft Teams in H2 CY18. Customers using hybrid voice or with needs for hybrid voice today can continue to use Skype for Business Online.

### What is the high-level approach administrators will need to take for the upgrade?

Administrators will need to pair the existing SBC that is connected to Cloud PBX via Cloud Connector Edition or an on-premises pool to the new architecture. At this point, the SBC will be intentionally connected to two architectures at the same time. After the pairing, administrators will be able to move users in the cloud and update their default UC client to Microsoft Teams.

### If a customer is planning to deploy Cloud PBX with hybrid connectivity, what are their options?

The ability to connect trunks to Cloud PBX via Cloud Connector Edition or existing pools continues to be available. In the future, when customers move to Microsoft Teams, the reconnection of SBC to the new architecture will be required. We are currently targeting that Cloud Connector Edition (CCE) or on-premises pool(s) will not be needed for the new architecture.

Client Experiences
------------------

### Will people-centric conversations be available in the new client?

One of the many advantages of using Microsoft Teams is that users gain access to new communication features. All chat is people-centric in Teams. Users can easily review their entire history of chat with other users easily from their client or browser. Searches are easier to execute.

### Will there be a UC-specific version of Teams for customers? 

The current plan is for IT to have controls to trim capabilities available in the client – keeping the features more familiar to their users until users are ready for the richer set of Teams capabilities. The full Teams capabilities are still available for users which are part of Teams or want to take advantage of those capabilities in the future.

### What is our VDI strategy for online customers?

VDI support is under evaluation for the future. We will make our roadmap available, so customer can assess Microsoft Teams for the business needs.

### Customers are sensitive to change management and training costs for their users. How are we investing to support our customers?

We will assist customers who wish to migrate users to Teams with tools and resources to control and manage the process including a FastTrack landing page with planning templates, technical and end-user readiness materials and best practices for effective change management. We will help ease the transition for users new to Microsoft Teams with a specialized first run experience and in-product coach marks. IT will have controls to trim capabilities available in the client – keeping the features more familiar until they are ready for the richer set of Teams capabilities. FastTrack, CSS and partners will be available to help support customers through the transition.

### Why do you believe Microsoft Teams delivers a preferred UI for collaboration and communication?

Microsoft has been evolving the visual design for UC continuously. Skype consumer design principles and especially the great direct feedback from their end-users have guided our approach to design for communication products. These updated design principles were introduced to our commercial products such as the Mac client. Elements such as flatter visuals, better usage of screen real estate for video, and full edge to edge screen sharing resulted in a better experience for customers. The learnings for this work then flowed to the latest Windows clients and Skype Room Systems V2 meeting design. And as we make the transition to Microsoft Teams, we see how the UI has evolved to a uniform experience across devices to produce a modern UI for collaboration and communication in Microsoft 365.

### Does Microsoft Teams have a full client for the Mac?

Yes, Microsoft provides a full Mac client for Microsoft Teams.

### Will there be parity between the Windows and MAC clients for Microsoft Teams?

One platform delivers both Windows and MAC client experiences for Microsoft Teams.

Meetings and Meeting Room Devices
---------------------------------

### What did Lenovo announce at Ignite?

### Lenovo announced the Smart Hub 500, the latest member of the Skype Room System family. The Smart Hub 500 is focused on powering Skype for Business meetings and simplifying collaboration experiences in Small to Medium spaces. Advantages include its compact footprint for huddle spaces and simple out of the box setup for IT Pros. Lenovo expects availability in 2018. No pricing has been shared at this time.

### What is the plan for video interoperability support for Teams meetings?

Meeting room devices are critical to our vision for the modern workplace.  Today, we announced that we are working with Blue Jeans and Pexip to deliver cloud video interoperability with Microsoft Teams. Customers can continue to use Polycom Real Connect for Office 365 with Skype for Business Online. We will make our roadmap available, so customers can assess Microsoft Teams for their business needs.

### Will the latest generation of Skype Room Systems support meetings in Teams?

Meeting room devices are critical to our vision for the modern workplace and we continue our momentum with Skype Room SysAt Ignite, Lenovo announced

Skype Rooms Systems will support meetings in Teams. Initially, Skype Room Systems will support single-click join to Teams meetings and most Skype Room Systems features except for dual screen support and panoramic video devices. Dual screens and panoramic devices will follow later.

### Will Skype Room Systems V1 be updated to support Microsoft Teams meetings? 

Meeting room devices are critical to our vision for the modern workplace.  Skype Room Systems v1 (aka Lync Room Systems) will have an upgrade available which will allow these devices to join Teams Meetings. As part of that upgrade process, we will also upgrade these devices from Windows 7 to Windows 10 to further secure the devices. For those devices using touch screens, you will lose access to touch features and features such as inking, PowerPoint annotation, and Whiteboarding, and front of room touch to start a meeting will stop working.

### Will Surface Hub have support for Teams?

Surface Hub and meeting room devices are critical to our vision for the modern workplace.  Today, Surface Hub has native support for Skype for Business Online and Server, and customers can login into the Teams web app to access Team meetings from Surface Hub.  Native support for Microsoft Teams is on our roadmap for the future.

### Is there a plan and timing for Cloud recording support for meetings? 

Cloud recording is an important need for many of our customers and we are planning to bring this capability to Microsoft Teams. We will make our roadmap available, so customers can assess Microsoft Teams for their business needs.

IT Pro Experiences
------------------

### What is planned for new Management experiences?

Microsoft plans to launch a new administration portal for IT Pros within the Office 365 Admin Center. Like the Skype for Business Admin Console, this new portal will be a single place to administer our new experiences. The initial release of the portal, targeted for early CY18, is designed to support Administration through an enterprise-ready policy model for Teams-only customers, replacing the existing administration interface for Teams. With this portal, we will be able to create custom presence, chat, app, meeting and voice policies and assign those policies to Teams users. Over time the capability in the admin portal will grow to include Call Analytics and the Call Quality Dashboard. Additionally, the new portal will include scenarios for Skype for Business Online customers, ultimately leading to the retirement of the existing Lync Admin Console (LAC).

### What are the plans for Call Analytics and CQD in the upgraded environment?

In the future, Call Analytics and the Call Quality Dashboard will show both Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Online calls so that customers can look at call quality and reliability proactively and reactively in these tools regardless of which clients are used.

### What happens with Skype Operations Framework?

As the products upgrade and come together, we are bringing together the practical guidance and frameworks for the Skype Operations Framework and Success with Teams include practical guidance, change management materials as well as adoption materials. This will range from 100-300 level content to provide an overview of what the transition will look like and how customers can start to pilot Microsoft Teams.

### What are the top benefits to IT for upgrading to Microsoft Teams?

Top benefits for IT include:

-   **Usage simplicity**. End users can access a broader set of functionalities through a single Teams client. For IT, this simplifies the training of their user base.

-   **Admin simplicity**. We’ve got a great new admin experience that brings together the information and settings you need to manage Teams and the UC services into a single new UI.

-   **Contextual communications**. By bringing together intelligent communications and collaboration, conversation, contacts and content are in a single place so content for a meeting is closely connected to the meeting and the results actions. Content and communications are captured and searchable within Teams.

Extensibility 
--------------

### What is the new extensibility vision?

A rich partner ecosystem and robust set of platform capabilities as essential to delivering on our vision for intelligent communications. To meet that need, we will invest in the three primary pillars of the O365 platform - intelligent services via Graph; extensible canvases and hub experiences in Teams and other Office clients; and embedded canvases and SDKs to enable 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps and services.

### What is happening with the Skype for Business Trusted Application API? 

All publicly available developer capabilities for Skype for Business Online (WebSDK, AppSDK for iOS / Android) will continue to be supported in their current versions. The current Trusted Application API capabilities and the Bot Framework for Skype for Business will remain available in public preview. Going forward, we intend to support similar scenarios and capabilities natively integrated with our next-gen core communications services and Teams client framework.
