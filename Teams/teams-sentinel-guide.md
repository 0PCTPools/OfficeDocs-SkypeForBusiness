# Azure Sentinel and Microsoft Teams

You can collect Teams activity logs in Azure Sentinel. If you manage both your 3rd party network devices and Microsoft Threat Protection in the same interface, pairing Microsoft Teams with Azure Sentinel puts your logs on one pane of glass. Your Security Operations Team will be able to hunt in Teams data from Sentinel, and bring the safety of your Teams collaborations to the fore.
