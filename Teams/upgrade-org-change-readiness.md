# Assess organizational change readiness - ROUGH

Once your project team is secured and your vision, scope/goals defined, the next step on your upgrade journey is ensuring organizational and user readiness, an activity completed in parallel with your technical readiness. To realize value from Teams, users must actually use it. Simply enabling Teams doesn’t guarantee goal achievement. Further, users have different use cases, varying learning styles and adapt to new technology at different speeds. The good news is that managing change isn’t all that complicated, but it does take a focused effort. The guided discussions below are designed to help you understand your user base so that you can prepare the right level of education to facilitate and accelerate user adoption. There are three ways you should look at your user base:

-   Organizational Change Readiness: Understanding how quickly (or not) users typically react to change. This information will help inform the amount of awareness, training and value-selling you may need to do to drive user adoption.
-   Use Cases: Evaluating how the new technology will improve user productivity. This information will make the change relevant for users based on how they work.
-   Personas: Assessing individuals or groups which may require personalized attention. This information will enable you to target training and awareness for those who expect or need more focused attention (eg Executives)

NOTE: The assessment activities provided below are adaptable to any change initiative in your organization. Simply address the questions based on the scope of your project. In the discussion of these activities, “new solution” can apply to Audio Calling, Audio Conferencing, or your upgrade from Skype for Business to Teams.

*Decision Points:*

-   *What is the culture your organization when it comes to change?*

-   *How can the new technology optimize the way users work?*

-   *Who are the users that may require special attention to get them to change
    the way they work?*

*Next Steps*

-   *Leverage the following guidance and associated activities to capture your
    organization’s user readiness profile.*

**Organizational Change Readiness:** An organizational readiness assessment
helps determine how receptive (or not) your users may be to changing the way
they work and adopting new technology. Understanding how users react to change,
empowers your organization to proactively address concerns, adjust your rollout
plan for optimal reception and identify users who can actually help you
faciliate the change with their peers.

>   **Activity:** Use the following conversation starters to conduct an
>   organizational readiness assessment and document the culture of your
>   organization when it comes to change. This information can help inform how
>   much awareness and training you might need to implement for your project.
>   Don’t worry about exact numbers. This exercise represents a general
>   understanding of your organizational culture. If you need help getting
>   started, simply evaluate a past rollout; this can help you anticipate how
>   users might react to change and help you proactively address the reactions
>   you expect.

-   **What percent of users fall unto each bucket?**

| **Type of User**                                               | **%** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| *Early adopters* – request the solution before it’s available  |       |
| *Informed* – accept the solution once value is demonstrated    |       |
| *Laggards* – Reject the solution, even when pushed into change |       |

>   *TIP: Enlist your early adopters for your pilot testing as well as to serve
>   as peer champions. Champions to help evangelize new technology and lead-by
>   example to show their peers how to realize value. Learn more about creating
>   a formal* [champions
>   program](https://fto365dev.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/DocResources/en-us/Office_365_Adoption_Guide.pdf)*.
>   Your laggards may need more convincing before adopting a new technology. If
>   more than 20% of your organization falls into this bucket, spend more time
>   communicating the value messaging and delivering tailored training. In
>   addition, support them through the change by open a feedback loop to better
>   understand and address their hesitations.*

-   **What % of users fall into each competency?**

    | **Type of Learner**                                                        | **%** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| *Self-motivated* – seek out resources, learn by doing                      |       |
| *Team-player* – group, interactive training; will go along with co-workers |       |
| *Hand-holding* – Expect white-glove or 1:1 assistance                      |       |

    > [!Tip]
    > Not everyone learns the same way. For those who are self-motivated, point to Microsoft’s online videos and training articles. If you have 20% or more in the Team Player category, enlist your training team or a partner to deliver live, interactive training (in person or online). Typically, you will find executives or targeted roles in the Hand-holding category. This is a critical group who would benefit from personalized, short training sessions. Enlist your champions to help deliver training to these users, for an optimal experience.*

1.  **Use Cases**. Articulating specific use cases in your awareness and
    training plan makes users feel like you truly are designing technology for
    the way they work. There are universal use cases (scenarios that apply to
    everyone in your organization regardless of role) as well as targeted use
    cases based on user profiles. For each, it’s important to identify the
    current process, challenges and how the new technology will optimize the
    user experience. Then, use that information in your communication plan to
    help showcase the value of the new technology and generate user desire to
    give it a try.

>   **Activity:** Document 5-7 universal and targeted use cases for your
>   organization. Here are some conversation starters to review with your
>   project team. In addition, see samples below.

-   What is your use case/scenario?

-   What are core characteristics that define this scenario today? What apps are
    being used?

-   What are the challenges faced today with this use case?

-   How can Teams optimize the user experience?

-   Select specific use cases to highlight in your communications.

      
    **Example of universal use cases for teamwork/collaboration**

| **Use Case**        | **Personal Productivity**                                         | **Meetings**                                                     | **Group Projects**                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Characteristics** | Daily “to do” list                                                | Conference calls or online meeting                               | Project work with many stakeholders                         |
| **Challenges**      | Emails/attachments get lost                                       | Little/no context pre-meeting                                    | Hallway conversations’ cause disconnect with group          |
| **With Teams**      | Send online and offline messages alleviating tracking people down | Build momentum pre-meeting with conversation and content sharing | Hold all conversations in team/channel driving transparency |

-   Dependency on others to get your job done

-   Internal and/or external attendees

-   In office/remote participants

-   Information/doc sharing

-   Utilizing multiple apps

-   Calls go to voicemail

-   Colleagues are offline

-   Outdated local copies on desktop

-   Remote participants feel left behind

-   Lack of visual connection

-   Challenging to catch-up if absent

-   Post-meeting momentum is lost

-   Frustration about doc location and versioning

-   Confusion about accountability

-   Persistent conversation with file attach reducing need to search multiple
    places or ending up with multiple versions

-   Join across devices

-   Connect with video, app sharing ensuring alignment

-   Record for absent attendees\*\*

-   Capture notes, actions (\@mention) for accountability and easy follow-up

*All within one interface!*

-   Link to relevant docs; pin critical ones to ensure visibility

**Example of targeted use case**

| **Use Case**        | **Marketing: Working on new product launch campaign**                                                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Characteristics** | Cross-team stakeholder status meetings                                                                               |
| **Challenges**      | Emailing creatives result in multiple versions                                                                       |
| **With Teams**      | Persistent conversation with file attach reducing need to search multiple places or ending up with multiple versions |

-   Campaign, creatives and messaging reviews with field, legal and PR teams

-   Project tracking to meet launch deadline

-   Hallway conversations’ cause disconnect with group

-   Tracking project note in One Note, status report in Word and conversations
    in IM and Email – too many tools to balance and keep aligned

-   One location for conversations, files, project notes and status reports
    enabling stakeholder to get and stay up to speed quickly

-   Pin project notes and status report to Tabs for easy access

-   \@mention team members when needing a response or feedback alleviating need
    to track them down or wait until they are online

-   **Personas**. People-level analsyis means understanding your user personas
    and use cases. Taking time to understand who your users are and how they
    work will enable you to ensure they have what they need to be successful
    implementing the change. This may inlude targeted messaging, training or
    even devices such as headsets and web cams. For example, an exeuctive may
    expect 1:1 training while a traveling field rep may benefit from a training
    video they can watch at their leisure. In addition, your people-level
    analysis can help identify who can move to Teams today versus who may be
    best served later on.

    Begin by segmenting your user base into persona/cohort groups (eg
    Executives, Road Warriors, Collaboration Workers, Retail, etc). For
    manageability, keep your list to no more than eight groups.

>   **Activity:** Identify targeted user profiles that require specific
>   technical/user readiness assistance. See below for a sample persona
>   assessment for an Executive profile.

| Persona/Profile: Executive                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                       |
