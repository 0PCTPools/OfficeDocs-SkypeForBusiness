# Assess organizational change readiness - ROUGH

Once your project team is secured and your vision, scope/goals defined, the next step on your upgrade journey is ensuring organizational and user readiness, an activity completed in parallel with your technical readiness. To realize value from Teams, users must actually use it. Simply enabling Teams doesn’t guarantee goal achievement. Further, users have different use cases, varying learning styles and adapt to new technology at different speeds. The good news is that managing change isn’t all that complicated, but it does take a focused effort. The guided discussions below are designed to help you understand your user base so that you can prepare the right level of education to facilitate and accelerate user adoption. There are three ways you should look at your user base:

-   Organizational Change Readiness: Understanding how quickly (or not) users typically react to change. This information will help inform the amount of awareness, training and value-selling you may need to do to drive user adoption.
-   Use Cases: Evaluating how the new technology will improve user productivity. This information will make the change relevant for users based on how they work.
-   Personas: Assessing individuals or groups which may require personalized attention. This information will enable you to target training and awareness for those who expect or need more focused attention (eg Executives)

NOTE: The assessment activities provided below are adaptable to any change initiative in your organization. Simply address the questions based on the scope of your project. In the discussion of these activities, “new solution” can apply to Audio Calling, Audio Conferencing, or your upgrade from Skype for Business to Teams.

*Decision Points:*

-   *What is the culture your organization when it comes to change?*

-   *How can the new technology optimize the way users work?*

-   *Who are the users that may require special attention to get them to change
    the way they work?*

*Next Steps*

-   *Leverage the following guidance and associated activities to capture your
    organization’s user readiness profile.*

## Organizational change readiness

An organizational readiness assessment helps determine how receptive (or not) your users may be to changing the way they work and adopting new technology. Understanding how users react to change, empowers your organization to proactively address concerns, adjust your rollout plan for optimal reception and identify users who can actually help you faciliate the change with their peers.

### Activity
Use the following conversation starters to conduct an organizational readiness assessment and document the culture of your organization when it comes to change. This information can help inform how much awareness and training you might need to implement for your project. Don’t worry about exact numbers. This exercise represents a general understanding of your organizational culture. If you need help getting started, simply evaluate a past rollout; this can help you anticipate how users might react to change and help you proactively address the reactions you expect.

#### What percent of users fall unto each bucket?

| **Type of User**                                               | **%** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| *Early adopters* – request the solution before it’s available  |       |
| *Informed* – accept the solution once value is demonstrated    |       |
| *Laggards* – Reject the solution, even when pushed into change |       |

> [!Tip]
> Enlist your early adopters for your pilot testing as well as to serve as peer champions. Champions to help evangelize new technology and lead-by example to show their peers how to realize value. Learn more about creating a formal [champions program](https://fto365dev.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/DocResources/en-us/Office_365_Adoption_Guide.pdf). Your laggards may need more convincing before adopting a new technology. If more than 20% of your organization falls into this bucket, spend more time communicating the value messaging and delivering tailored training. In addition, support them through the change by open a feedback loop to better understand and address their hesitations.

#### What percent of users fall into each competency?

| **Type of Learner**                                                        | **%** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| *Self-motivated* – seek out resources, learn by doing                      |       |
| *Team-player* – group, interactive training; will go along with co-workers |       |
| *Hand-holding* – Expect white-glove or 1:1 assistance                      |       |

> [!Tip]
> Not everyone learns the same way. For those who are self-motivated, point to Microsoft’s online videos and training articles. If you have 20% or more in the Team Player category, enlist your training team or a partner to deliver live, interactive training (in person or online). Typically, you will find executives or targeted roles in the Hand-holding category. This is a critical group who would benefit from personalized, short training sessions. Enlist your champions to help deliver training to these users, for an optimal experience.*

## Use cases

Articulating specific use cases in your awareness and training plan makes users feel like you truly are designing technology for the way they work. There are universal use cases (scenarios that apply to everyone in your organization regardless of role) as well as targeted use cases based on user profiles. For each, it’s important to identify the current process, challenges and how the new technology will optimize the user experience. Then, use that information in your communication plan to help showcase the value of the new technology and generate user desire to give it a try.

### Activity

Document 5-7 universal and targeted use cases for your organization. Here are some conversation starters to review with your project team. In addition, see samples below. 

-   What is your use case/scenario?

-   What are core characteristics that define this scenario today? What apps are
    being used?

-   What are the challenges faced today with this use case?

-   How can Teams optimize the user experience?

-   Select specific use cases to highlight in your communications.

 The following table shows examples of universal use cases for teamwork and collaboration.

## Personas

People-level analsyis means understanding your user personas and use cases. Taking time to understand who your users are and how they work will enable you to ensure they have what they need to be successful implementing the change. This may inlude targeted messaging, training or even devices such as headsets and web cams. For example, an exeuctive may expect 1:1 training while a traveling field rep may benefit from a training video they can watch at their leisure. In addition, your people-level analysis can help identify who can move to Teams today versus who may be best served later on.

Begin by segmenting your user base into persona/cohort groups (eg Executives, Road Warriors, Collaboration Workers, Retail, etc). For manageability, keep your list to no more than eight groups.

### Activity

Identify targeted user profiles that require specific technical/user readiness assistance. See below for a sample persona assessment for an Executive profile.

|                            |                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **What are core characteristics that define this persona (eg who are they, what do they do)?**    | <ul><li>Voice/brand of organization internally and externally</li><li>Relationship focused</li><li>Fast-paced, dynamic schedules</li><li>Utilize mobile devices to stay connected</li><li>Rely on delegates as their ‘eyes and ears’</li><li>Spend majority of day in meetings or on phone calls</li></ul>  |
| **What are common use cases for this persona?** *Apply the universal use cases above to this persona then elaborate on specific scenarios.* | <ul><li>Personal Productivity<ul><li>Customer, rapport-building calls</li></ul></li><li>Meetings<ul><li>C-level/Stakeholder reviews</li><li>1:Many – All hands</li></ul></li><li>Project Collaboration</li></ul>         |
