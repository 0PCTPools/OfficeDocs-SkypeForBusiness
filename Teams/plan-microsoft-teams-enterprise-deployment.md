# Plan your enterprise-wide rollout of Microsoft Teams

Teams consists of 4 workloads, which you can roll out as your organization is ready. 
- [Chat, teams, & channels](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Tabs, apps, bots, & connectors](deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Meetings & conferencing](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Cloud voice](cloud-voice-landing-page.md)





|Your organization's profile|Guided path  |
|---------|---------|
|![journey](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-journey.png)<BR>I'm currently using Skype for Business Online, and would like to move to Teams. |We have specific step-by-step guidance for you! Go to [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](Journey-SkypeforBusiness-Teams.md)        |
|![enterprise](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-Enterprise.png)<BR>I need help to make sure that my Teams rollout is successful and that all my users adopt Teams. | Go to the [Teams Adoption Hub](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) for guidance, tools, and resources to help your organization get the most out of Teams.       |
|![server](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-onprem-to-teams.png)<BR>My organization is running Skype for Business Server, and I want to roll out Teams.  |For a full-scale rollout, first you need to configure hybrid connectivity between your on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Start by reading [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity).   |
|![pstn to teams](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-pstn-to-teams.png)<BR>I don't have Skype for Business Server, but I do have an on-premises PSTN solution. How do I integrate that with Teams?|We recommend that you use Phone System Direct Routing to hook up your on-premises PSTN solution with Teams. To get started, read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).|
