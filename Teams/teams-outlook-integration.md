# Teams and Outlook email integration

These features make it easier to share information between email and chat.

## Share to Teams

Share to Teams is an Outlook add-in that lets users share an email from Outlook, including attachments, along with a message to a chat or channel in Teams. A preview of the email is displayed in Teams and people in the chat or channel can open any attachments.

## Share to Outlook

Share to Outlook lets users share a copy of a Teams conversation to an email in Outlook, without having to leave Teams. 

## Actionable activity emails

Users get actionable missed activity emails which make it easy to stay on top of a missed conversation in Teams. The missed activity emails show the latest replies from a conversation including messages sent after the missed message and lets users respond directly from within Outlook.
