                         Standard fit out of Contoso’s office workspaces includes a desktop phone for every desk and each employee will be provided with a direct inward dialing (DID) phone number. The desktop phones are connected to a PBX system and connected to PSTN via session initiation protocol (SIP) trunk. Employee can only make and receive phone calls at their assigned desktop phones.                                                        |

                         Usage analysis of the desktop phones shows that only 10% of the desktop phones are actively used, with the rest either configured to forward calls to mobile phones, or configured to simultaneously ring to mobile phones. Maintenance of existing PBX system and the associated desktop phones contributes to 20% of monthly telephony service cost.                                                                                  |

                         Phone System with Calling Plan service will allow end user’s personal computer to receive and place phone calls over data network by leveraging the native Microsoft Teams app, removing the necessity to roll out and maintain desktop phones, and opens the opportunity to decommission the existing PBX system as the phone service can be delivered via the cloud over the network with no dependency on traditional phone system.  |
