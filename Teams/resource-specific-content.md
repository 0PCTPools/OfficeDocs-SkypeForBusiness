# Resource-specific content in Microsoft Teams

Your Teams app can now call Teams Graph APIs without the need for an admin to give consent. These include APIs to create, rename, and delete channels, read channel messages, create tabs, and add and remove members from teams.
 
Previously, apps that call Teams Graph APIs required a global admin to approve the app before it could be run, and required very high levels of permissions that admins were reluctant to grant. Resource-specific consent eliminates this friction by allowing team owners to give consent to an app to use only their team's data, without the need for a global admin to approve the app tenant-wide. To the team owner, it will look just like any other Teams app, only with more powerful permissions.
