# Planning and preparing your network

# Prepare your network
To ensure optimal and consistent performance, you should prepare your network for Teams.

## Why should you prepare your network?

Before we look at the steps to be taken, it’s important to understand what can affect the performance of Teams and thereby user happiness and satisfaction. Three major risk areas can affect how users perceive network quality:
- Insufficient bandwidth available
- Firewall and proxy blockers
- Network impairments such as jitter and packet loss
The steps described below will help you determine whether your deployment might be affected by any of these factors and will help you move toward a resolution. Failing to prepare your network will likely lead to dissatisfied users and costly, ad-hoc fixes. By preparing your network—and your organization—for Teams, you can dramatically increase your chance of success.
