# Manage firstline workers in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out to Teams over time. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](https://support.office.com/article/microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired-30ca17f3-5502-4bc9-bb0a-bed04bb362f0).  

## Overview of Shifts
The Shifts app in Teams is designed to connect firstline workers to their company. It's built mobile first for fast and effective time management and communication for teams. 
- Fast schedule creation and coordination 
- Communicate in the moment to keep everyone in the know, and connect the company to their firstline workers in Teams 
- Give your team quick access to information they need right in Office 365 
- Get the enterprise-level security and compliance features you expect from Office 365

 Shifts is built for the mobile needs of firstline workers on top of Office 365. Being part of Office 365 means Shifts comes with built-in integrations to Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Teams, and Office 365 Groups. This allows you to maximize your Office 365 investments, while providing a simple and secure user experience across tools. 

Shifts lets workers and their managers use their mobile devices to manage schedules and keep in touch. 

- Managers create, update, and manage shift schedules for the team. They can also send messages to one person ("there's a spill on the floor") or the entire team ("the regional GM is arriving in 20 minutes"). They can send policy documents, news bulletins, or videos. 
- Employees view their upcoming shifts at a glance, can see who else is scheduled for the day, and can request to swap a shift.

## Configure Shifts
Shifts app is available to customers as part of the Office 365 Enterprise, Small-business, and EDU suite licensing plans: Office 365 K1, E1, E3, and E5 (including the Education version of these plans). 
As an Office 365 customer, Shifts is available for your entire organization. Before you deploy Shifts, there are a few things you should know about the settings in the Office 365 admin center. 

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal with your Office 365 admin account to configure the Shifts app in Microsoft Teams. The Shifts app is enabled and installed by default for all Teams users and can be disabled through the Office admin portal. 
2. Assigning the Firstline worker admin set-up policy will pin the Shifts app to the navigation bar in Microsoft Teams. The Firstline worker buil-in app setup policy pins the Activity, Shifts, Chat and Calling apps to the app bar and all remaining enabled apps will be in the More apps for Web/Desktop client and app bar in Teams mobile client. 

## Security & Compliance

Shifts in Teams protects team data securely using strong security measures including two factor authentication, hard passwords and access policies. Your data is encrypted, whether it is chat, notes or files. It’s your data, you own it, you control it. Microsoft does not mine customer data for advertising purposes and we safeguard customer data with strong contractual commitments. 

### Where is Shifts data stored?

### Does Shifts meet our compliance requirements? 
Our compliance framework provides visibility into Office 365’s compliance with global, regional, and industry standards, and details how customers can control Office 365 services based on compliance needs.
