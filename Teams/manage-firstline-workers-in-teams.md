# Manage firstline workers in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out to Teams over time. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](https://support.office.com/article/microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired-30ca17f3-5502-4bc9-bb0a-bed04bb362f0).  

## Overview of Shifts
The Shifts app in Teams keeps firstline workers connected and in sync. It's built mobile first for fast and effective time management and communication for teams. Shifts lets firstline workers and their managers use their mobile devices to manage schedules and keep in touch. 

- Managers create, update, and manage shift schedules for the team. They can send messages to one person ("there's a spill on the floor") or the entire team ("the regional GM is arriving in 20 minutes"). They can also send policy documents, news bulletins, and videos. 
- Employees view their upcoming shifts, can see who else is scheduled for the day, request to swap or offer a shift, and request time off. 

## Availability of Shifts

Shifts is available in all Office 365 subscriptions that includes Teams, with a couple of exceptions. The exceptions are US Government Cloud Community (GCC) and Teams free. Shifts isn't available in Office 365 US Government or Teams free offerings.

To learn more about licensing for Teams, see [Office 365 licensing for Teams](Office-365-licensing.md).

## Set up Shifts

### Enable or disable Shifts in your organization

The Shifts app is enabled by default for all Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on the app in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center with your Office 365 admin account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Services & add-ins** > **Microsoft Teams**. 
3. Under **Tenant-wide settings**, select **Apps**, and then under **Default Apps**, clear or select the **Shifts** check box to turn off or turn on the app.

### Assign a FirstLineWorker app setup policy

2. Assigning the Firstline worker admin set-up policy will pin the Shifts app to the navigation bar in Microsoft Teams. The Firstline worker buil-in app setup policy pins the Activity, Shifts, Chat and Calling apps to the app bar and all remaining enabled apps will be in the More apps for Web/Desktop client and app bar in Teams mobile client. 

To lean more, go to [Manage app setup policies in Teams](teams-app-setup-policies.md)
