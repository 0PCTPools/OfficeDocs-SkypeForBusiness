# Manage firstline workers in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities, including schedule and task management, into Microsoft Teams. Additional capabilities for firstline workers will roll out to Teams over time. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](https://support.office.com/article/microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired-30ca17f3-5502-4bc9-bb0a-bed04bb362f0).  

## Overview of Shifts
The Shifts app in Teams keeps firstline workers connected and in sync. It's built mobile first for fast and effective time management and communication for teams. Shifts lets firstline workers and their managers use their mobile devices to manage schedules and keep in touch. 

- Managers create, update, and manage shift schedules for the team. They can send messages to one person ("there's a spill on the floor") or the entire team ("the regional GM is arriving in 20 minutes"). They can also send policy documents, news bulletins, and videos. 
- Employees view their upcoming shifts, can see who else is scheduled for the day, request to swap or offer a shift, and request time off. 

## Availability of Shifts

Shifts is available in all Office 365 plans that include Teams, with a few exceptions. The exceptions are US Government Cloud Community (GCC) and Teams free. Shifts isn't available in Office 365 US Government or Teams free offerings.

To learn more about licensing for Teams, see [Office 365 licensing for Teams](Office-365-licensing.md).

## Set up Shifts

### Enable or disable Shifts in your organization

Shifts is enabled by default for all Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on the app in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center with your Office 365 admin account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Services & add-ins** > **Microsoft Teams**. 
3. Under **Tenant-wide settings**, select **Apps**, and then under **Default Apps**, clear or select the **Shifts** check box to turn off or turn on the app.

### Use the FirstLineWorker app setup policy to pin Shifts to Teams

App setup policies let you customize Teams to highlight the apps that are most important for users in your organization. The apps set in a policy are pinned to the app bar in Teams for quick and easy access by users. 
 
Teams includes a built-in FirstLineWorker app setup policy. By default, the policy includes the Activity, Shifts, Chat, and Calling apps. You can edit the policy and assign it to firstline workers in your organization.
