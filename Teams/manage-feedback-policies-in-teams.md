# Manage feedback policies in Microsoft Teams

Users can send comments and suggestions about Teams to Microsoft by going to **Help** > **Give feedback** in the Teams clients. We're continually improving the Teams experience and we use this feedback to make Teams better.

> [!NOTE]
> Data sent through **Give feedback** is considered as "Support Data" under your Office 365 agreement, including information that would otherwise be considered "Customer Data" or "Personal Data".

As an admin, you can use feedback policies in the Microsoft Teams admin center to control whether users in your organization can send feedback about Teams to Microsoft. By default, all users in your organization are automatically assigned the global (Org-wide default) policy. You can edit the global policy or create and assign a custom policy. If a user is assigned a custom policy, that policy applies to the user. If a user isn't assigned a custom policy, the global policy applies to the user.

Say, for example, you want to allow all users in your organization to send feedback except for new hires in training. In this scenario, you create a custom policy to turn off the feedback option and assign it to new hires and apply the global policy to turn on the feedback option for all other users in your organization.

## Create a custom feedback policy

After you create a custom policy, assign it to users for the changes to take effect. 

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Feedback policies**. 
2. Select **New policy**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the policy.
4. Turn on or turn off **Users can send feedback to Microsoft**, and then click **Save**.

## Edit a feedback policy

You can edit the global policy or any custom policies that you create. 

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Feedback policies**. 
2. Select the policy you want to edit.
3. Turn on or turn off **Users can send feedback to Microsoft**, and then click **Save**.

## Assign a custom feedback policy to users

You can use the Microsoft Teams admin center to assign a custom policy to individual users or the Skype for Business PowerShell module  to assign a custom policy to groups of users, such as a security group or distribution group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend using PowerShell only to assign policies to users. Use the Microsoft Teams admin center to create, edit, and manage policies.

### Assign a custom feedback policy to individual users

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Users**, and then click  the user.
2. Next to **Assigned policies**, choose **Edit**.
3. Under **Feedback policy**, select the policy you want to assign, and then choose **Save**.

You can also assign an app setup policy to one or more users as follows:

1. Go to **Microsoft Teams admin center** > **Teams apps** > **Feedback policies**.
2. Select the policy by clicking to the left of the policy name.
3. Select **Manage users**.
4. In the **Manage users** pane, search for the user by display name or by user name, select the name, and then select **Add**. Repeat this step for each user that you want to add.
5. When you're finished adding users, select **Save**.

### Assign a custom app setup policy to users in a group

You may want to assign a custom app setup policy to multiple users that youâ€™ve already identified. For example, you may want to assign a policy to all users in a security group. You can do this by connecting to the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module and the Skype for Business PowerShell module.
