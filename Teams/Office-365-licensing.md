In terms of Teams core functionalities, there are no differences between the different Office 365 subscriptions. The availability of the compliance capabilities does rely on the correct subscription level. To learn more, read [Overview of security and compliance in Teams](security-compliance-overview.md).

All supported subscription plans are eligible for access to the Teams web client, desktop clients, and mobile apps.

Teams isn't available as a standalone service.

> [!TIP]
> To manage user-level licensing, see [Manage user access to Microsoft Teams](user-access.md).
