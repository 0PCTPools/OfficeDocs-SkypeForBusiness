# Quality of Experience Review Guide
The Quality Experience Review Guide has a set of activities that assess and
provide remediation guidance in key areas that have the greatest impact for
improving user experience, as shown in the figure below.

![The key areas to examine during a quality experience review: audio, reliability, and user survey results.](media/plan-my-service-management-image2.png "The key areas to examine during a quality experience review: audio, reliability, and user survey results.")

By continually assessing and remediating the areas described in this document,
you can reduce their potential to negatively affect user experience. Most
user-experience problems encountered in a deployment can be grouped into the
following categories:

-   Incomplete firewall or proxy configuration

-   Poor Wi-Fi coverage

-   Insufficient bandwidth

-   VPN

-   Use of unoptimized or built-in audio devices

-   Problematic subnets or network devices

The guidance provided in the Quality Experience Review Guide focuses on using
Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) Online as the primary tool to report and
investigate each area described, with a focus on audio to maximize adoption and
impact. Any optimizations made to the network to improve the audio experience
will also directly translate to improvements in video and desktop sharing.

We highly recommend that you nominate the quality champion early on. After being
nominated, they should start to familiarize themselves with the content in the
[Quality Experience Review Guide](https://aka.ms/qerguide).
