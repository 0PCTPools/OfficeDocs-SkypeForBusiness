#Cloud voice deployment

Microsoft Teams, the hub for teamwork and communications in Office 365, now provides Audio Conferencing and Phone System with Calling Plans capabilities to meet additional business requirements by extending the Teams meeting and calling experience to include external parties connected via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
 
We'll update this page as additional cloud voice features for Teams are released over time.

## Phone System with Calling Plans in Microsoft Teams

Phone System is an Office 365 feature that provides the ability to manage call routing, policies, and user provisioning. This includes phone calling management system, call routing, and call control.

Office 365 Calling Plans is an add-on service for the Phone System feature, delivered through Teams and Skype for Business Online. Calling Plans provide the people in your business with a primary phone number and lets them make and receive phone calls outside of your organization over the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
