Cloud voice deployment
======================

Microsoft Teams, the hub for teamwork and communications in Office 365, now provides Office 365 Audio Conferencing ("Public Preview") capabilities to meet additional business requirements by extending the Teams meeting experience to include participants joining via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
 
Use the practical guidance in [Audio Conferencing](audio-conferencing.md) to help you plan for Audio Conferencing ("Public Preview") in Teams.
 
We'll update this page as cloud voice features for Teams are released over time.
