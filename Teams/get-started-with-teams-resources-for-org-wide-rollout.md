# Choose a path to your organization-wide rollout of Microsoft Teams

Now that you've successfully set up your first teams, onboarded an initial group of users while driving usage, it's time to look at your go-forward plan to deploy Teams across the rest of your organization while driving adoption. Teams consists of 4 workloads, which you can roll out as your organization is ready. 
- [Chat, teams, & channels](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Meetings and conferencing](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Cloud voice](cloud-voice-landing-page.md)
- [Apps](deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)

Additionally, we've developed guided paths for deploying Teams depending on your organization's profile. Pick your path:


|Your organization's profile|Guided path  |
|---------|---------|
|![SMB](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-SMB.png)<BR>I'm a small business with fewer than 50 users, and I'm not planning to do phone calling yet. |Just follow our [Quick start](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md), and you'll be on your way!<BR> <BR>When you're ready to add other workloads, go to [Chat, teams, & channels](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md), [Meetings](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md), [Cloud voice](cloud-voice-landing-page.md), or [Apps](deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md).  |
|![journey](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-journey.png)<BR>I'm currently using Skype for Business Online, and would like to move to Teams. |Go to [Upgrade from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams](Journey-SkypeforBusiness-Teams.md).        |
|![enterprise](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-Enterprise.png)<BR>I'm responsible for more than 500 users, and need help to make sure that my rollout is successful. |Go to the [Teams Adoption Hub](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)] for guidance, tools, and resources to help your organization get the most out of Teams. |
|![server](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-onprem-to-teams.png)<BR>My organization is running Skype for Business Server, and I want to roll out Teams. |For a full-scale rollout, first you need to configure hybrid connectivity between your on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Start by reading [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity).     |
|![pstn to teams](media/deploy-teams-landing-page-pstn-to-teams.png)<BR>I don't have Skype for Business Server, but I do have an on-premises PSTN solution. How do I integrate that with Teams?|We recommend that you use Phone System Direct Routing to hook up your on-premises PSTN solution with Teams. To get started, read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).|
