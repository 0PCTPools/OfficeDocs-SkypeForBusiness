# Policy control overview for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft is committed to providing you with the information and controls you need to make choices about how your data is collected and used when you’re using Microsoft Teams, a part of Microsoft 365.

This article is intended to provide you with new, updated, and improved privacy controls for the following areas:

- **Diagnostic data** that is collected and sent to Microsoft about Teams and Office software being used on computers running Windows in your organization.
- **Connected experiences** that use cloud-based functionality to provide enhanced Teams and Office features to you and your users.

As part of these changes, there are new and updated user interface (UI) elements and policy settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For further reading, please review the [Policy Control Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/privacy/overview-privacy-controls) content for M365.

## Diagnostic data sent from Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise to Microsoft

Diagnostic data is used to:

- Keep Teams secure and up-to-date.
- Detect, diagnose and remediate problems.
- Make product improvements.

This data does not include ADD TEAMS SPECIFIC STUFF THAT'S NOT INCLUDED HERE.
**ADD STUFF**



This diagnostic data is collected and sent to Microsoft about Teams software being used on computers running Windows in your organization.

There are three levels of diagnostic data for Teams software that you can choose from:

- **Required** The minimum data necessary to help keep Office secure, up-to-date, and performing as expected on the device it’s installed on.
- **Optional** Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.
- **Neither** No diagnostic data about Teams software running on the user’s device is collected and sent to us. This option, however, significantly limits our ability to detect, diagnose, and remediate problems your users may encounter using Teams.

Required diagnostic data could include, for example, information about the version of Teams client installed on the device, or include information that indicates that the Teams application is crashing when trying to join a meeting. Optional diagnostic data could include information about the time it takes to initiate a phone call, which could indicate an issue with connectivity or network performance.

If you choose to send us optional diagnostic data, required diagnostic data is also included.

As an admin for your organization, you’ll be able to use a policy setting to choose which level of diagnostic data is sent to us. Optional diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft unless you change the setting. Providing optional diagnostic data better enables the Office engineering team at Microsoft to detect, diagnose, and mitigate issues to reduce impacts to your organization.

Your users won’t be able to change the diagnostic data level for their devices if they are signed in to Teams with their organizational credentials, which is sometimes referred to as a work or school account.


IS CONTENT FILES CORRECT HERE? NEED SPECIFIC INFO AGAIN.
This diagnostic data doesn’t include names of users, their email addresses, or the content of their Office files. Our system creates a unique ID that it associates with your user’s diagnostic data. When we receive diagnostic data showing that the Teams app crashed 100 times, this unique ID lets us determine if it was a single user who crashed 100 times or if it was 100 different users who each crashed once. We don’t use this unique ID to identify a specific user.

To see what diagnostic data is being sent to Microsoft, you can use the Diagnostic Data Viewer, which you can download and install for free [from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/diagnostic-data-viewer/9n8wtrrsq8f7?rtc=1).
