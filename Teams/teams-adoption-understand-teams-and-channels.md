# Understand teams and channels

The concepts of teams and channels are fundamental to a healthy, productive implementation of Microsoft Teams. 

A team is a collection of people, content, and tools that facilitates a business outcome for your company. A healthy team defines who its members are and the permissions and policies that apply to those members. Teams are built on Office 365 Groups, and changes to Office 365 group membership sync to the team. Like other Office 365 Groups, teams come automatically provisioned with an Exchange mailbox, a SharePoint site, a OneNote notebook and other Office 365 assets. [Learn more about Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/article/Learn-about-Office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2).
Channels

Channels are the collaboration spaces within a team in which the actual work is done. Each channel represents a different topic or workstream within the overall team. For each channel, a folder is automatically created on the SharePoint site to store all files stored in that channel, making it easy for users to find and work on the documents they care about. A Wiki is automatically created to share notes relevant to that topic of work. Channels can also be extended with apps that are relevant to the particular workstreamâ€”for example, you can add a Power BI dashboard to a channel to track the success of one aspect of your project. By default channels and their content are accessible to all members of the team. 

## Team access types

Team access types determine who can join the team:

- *Private* teams are restricted to team members approved by the team owner(s). This is a typical setting for project teams and virtual teams in a large organization.
- 
- *Public* teams are open to anyone in the organization, and users can join them directly. Public teams are useful for collaboration on topics of general interest to people in different departments or to people who are working on different projects. This is a good default setting for smaller organizations.

## Use Teams to drive cross-organization collaboration

It's a best practice to use teams to improve cross-organization collaboration, and many projects will lend themselves to this model. In addition, leaders or divisions inside of an organization might want a dedicated team for their own people. Consider the organizational and project models shown in the following illustration.
