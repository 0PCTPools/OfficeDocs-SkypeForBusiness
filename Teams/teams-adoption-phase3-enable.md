# Phase 3 â€“ Enable 

In this phase, you will use your learnings, talented project team, and relationships with stakeholders, champions, and early adopters to support the broad scale enablement of Teams for your organization. Teams is a transformative technology, so depending on the size of your organization and your existing technology you may take different approaches. Consider these enablement strategies:

| Teams First | Teams Core | Teams Go Big | Skype Side by Side | Migration |
|------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------ | --------- |
| Lead cloud deployment with Microsoft Teams | Lead collaboration scenario enablement with Microsoft Teams | All employees on Teams and organization-wide teams | Enable Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business | Migrate users from Skype for Business to Teams |
| - Applicable to new or low usage Office 365 customers <br/>- Lead with Teams in customer-specific scenario <br/>- Highlight integrated user experience and accelerated time to value for Office 365 <br/>- Conduct planning workload enablement together to avoid serial implementation | - Enable Teams along with OneDrive and SharePoint Online <br/>- Create a company intranet to share news resources and video with Microsoft Stream<br/>**Better together**: <br/>Teams<br/>SharePoint<br/>Yammer<br/>Planner<br/>PowerApps |- For customers with less than 1000 seats (current limitation)<br/>- Enable cross organization collaboration with one team for all<br/>- Automate common tasks (vacation requests, employee surveys, executive engagement) |- Use Teams Core tactics to accelerate collaboration<br/>- Highlight meeting scenario guidance based on size and feature set required<br/>
- Use Skype for Business for enterprise calling, interoperability, and hybrid scenarios<br/>- Use public roadmap for capability planning |-	Plan move to Teams from Skype for Business by creating service strategy roadmap for the customer<br/>- Attach to feature release schedule<br/> Recommend including Side by Side and Teams Core to ease transition

> [!NOTE]
> The following are our recommendations for most customer organizations.  However, there are exceptions. To get guidance for any scenario not covered here, ask your questions in our Driving Adoption community or reach out to the FastTrack team or Microsoft partner network.

- **Choose Teams First or Teams Core**: Most organizations have an existing investment in Microsoft technology. You may be enabling more than one workload at a time, such as Exchange Online, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint. In these cases, selecting Teams First or Teams Core is a wise choice. It will enable your users to get used to the enhanced collaboration experience of Microsoft Teams. Your collaboration project team can then plan to roll out additional capabilities and the  training and support required for them to be successful. 

- **Choose Teams Go Big**: In new Office 365 customer organizations it is often best to take a Teams Go Big approach to minimize the change fatigue caused by learning new technology multiple times. You will get the greatest benefit by enabling Teams for both core collaboration and meetings, SharePoint, OneDrive, Planner, and other workloads, and allowing your employees to learn about them in the context of your Teams deployment. 

    Teams Go Big is also the preferred enablement strategy for organizations under 1,000 employees who want to simplify their employee communication and engagement. Using the organization-wide team can bring people together to review common tasks and initiatives on any device. 

- **Choose Side by Side**:  For organizations that are using Skype for Business for audio conferencing, support for conference room devices, or cloud voice capabilities, we recommend running Teams and Skype side by side to familiarize your employees with the core collaboration features--while planning your migration off of Skype for Business at a time that is convenient to your company. Note that running both clients side by side can introduce user confusion about which tool to use, so we recommend keeping this phase in your adoption journey short. 

- **Choose Migration**:  Migrating from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams has additional components from a technical perspective, but the user adoption journey has the same components as a Teams Go Big implementation. In addition, you will be educating people about the Teams meeting experience and interface, the new persistent chat behavior, and other elements of the experience that are different from Skype for Business.

For each enablement strategy, it is essential to work closely with your technical readiness team to ensure that your environment will deliver a great employee experience. 

## Selecting your Service Strategy and Managing Stakeholders

Communication and managing expectations is a key element in a successful change project. It is important to regularly communicate your overall vision and your progress toward that goal to your stakeholders.
