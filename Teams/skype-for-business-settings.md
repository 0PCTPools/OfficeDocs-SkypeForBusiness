# Manage Skype for Business settings in the Microsoft Teams admin center

As an admin, the Microsoft Teams admin center is where you manage settings for Skype for Business features for Skype for Business users in your organization. You can manage settings for your organization and for individual Skype for Business users.

## Manage Skype for Business settings for your organization

In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Org-wide settings** > **Skype for Business**. From here, you can configure and manage Skype Meeting Broadcast, presence settings, and mobile phone notifications for all Skype for Business users in your organization.

### Skype for Business Meeting Broadcast

Use the following settings to manage [Skype Meeting Broadcast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-a-skype-meeting-broadcast-c472c76b-21f1-4e4b-ab58-329a6c33757d):

- **Skype Meeting Broadcasts**: Turn this on to enable Skype Meeting Broadcast for your organization. After you enable this feature, you need to [set up your network for Skype Meeting Broadcast](../Skype/SfbOnline/set-up-your-network-for-skype-meeting-broadcast/set-up-your-network-for-skype-meeting-broadcast.md).
- **See preview features**: Turn this on to get early access to new products and features. This gives your organization a sneak peek at what's coming and the opportunity to test new features in your own environment and give feedback before we release product builds to the general public.
- **Organizers can schedule anonymous meetings**: Turn this on if you want to let organizers create broadcast events that allow anyone outside your organization to join without having to sign in. 
- **Record Skype Meeting Broadcast meetings**: Turn this on to enable organizers and presenters to record meetings.  
- **Helpdesk support URL for attendees**: Enter your organization's support URL that meeting attendees can use if they need help during a meeting.
