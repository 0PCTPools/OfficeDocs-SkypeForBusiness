# Manage Skype for Business settings in the Microsoft Teams admin center

As an admin, the Microsoft Teams admin center is where you manage settings for Skype for Business features for Skype for Business users in your organization. You can manage settings for your organization and for individual Skype for Business users.

## Manage Skype for Business settings for your organization

In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Org-wide settings** > **Skype for Business**. From here, you can configure and manage Skype Meeting Broadcast, presence settings, and mobile phone notifications for all Skype for Business users in your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings were previously in **Legacy portal** in the Microsoft Teams admin center. The **Legacy portal** has been retired and these settings were moved to the **Skype for Business** page.

### Skype for Business Meeting Broadcast

Use the following settings to manage [Skype Meeting Broadcast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-a-skype-meeting-broadcast-c472c76b-21f1-4e4b-ab58-329a6c33757d) in your organization:

- **Skype Meeting Broadcasts**: Turn this on to enable Skype Meeting Broadcast for your organization. After you enable this feature, you need to [set up your network for Skype Meeting Broadcast](../Skype/SfbOnline/set-up-your-network-for-skype-meeting-broadcast/set-up-your-network-for-skype-meeting-broadcast.md).
- **See preview features**: Turn this on to get early access to new products and features. This gives your organization a sneak peek at what's coming and the opportunity to test new features in your own environment and give feedback before we release product builds to the general public.
- **Organizers can schedule anonymous meetings**: Turn this on if you want to let organizers create broadcast events that allow anyone outside your organization to join without having to sign in. 
- **Record Skype Meeting Broadcast meetings**: Turn this on to enable organizers and presenters to record meetings.  
- **Helpdesk support URL for attendees**: Enter your organization's support URL that meeting attendees can use if they need help during a meeting.

### Presence

By default, anyone in your organization (whether in Teams or Skype for Business) can see the availability status (such as Available, Busy, or Away) of other Skype for Business users. You can set who can see the presence of your Skype for Business users.

- **Automatically display presence information**: Anyone in your organization who hasn't been added to the Skype for Business user's **External** or **Blocked** list can see that user's presence.
- **Display presence information only to a user's contacts**: Anyone in the Skype for Business user's Contacts list who isn't added to their **External** or **Blocked** list can see that user's presence. Users can override this setting by going to **Settings** > **Tools** > **Options** in Skype for Business.

### Mobile phone notifications

You can set whether your Skype for Business mobile users get alerts about incoming and missed instant messages, voicemail messages, and missed calls through a push notification service instead of through Microsoft 365. Depending on the mobile devices used in your organization, you can use the **Microsoft Push Notification Service**, the **Apple Push Notification Service**, or both.

Keep in mind the following:

- If you turn off push notifications,  users will get all alerts the next time they start Skype for Business on their mobile device.
- By default, push notifications are turned on. Individual users can turn them off in Skype for Business on their mobile device.
- When you turn off push notifications, users can't turn them back on. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Microsoft uses other companies to provide real-time Skype for Business mobile notifications for Windows Phone, iPhone, and iPad users. See the [Privacy Statement for Microsoft Skype for Business Products](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=247732).
