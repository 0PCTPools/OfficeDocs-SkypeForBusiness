Prepare for your journey to Microsoft Teams
===========================================

Introduction
------------

Change takes time. Your organization has deployment lifecycles, resource planning, technical readiness and change management to consider. We are working hard to ensure Microsoft Teams meets your needs for long-term success. While we work to get things ready for you, here are a few ways you can get started with your preparations today. 

Scope
-----

To ensure a smooth implementation of Teams, we have created a set of steps for you to follow. By completing these steps, you can drive a successful Teams implementation within your organization.

This guide is split in two portions:

1.  **Prerequired Steps** contain guidance that must be taken before any Teams implementation. These steps are focused on ensuring a healthy start of your Teams implementation.

2.  The **Environmental Requirements** focus on Teams dependencies with existing Office 365 technologies such as SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and OneDrive for Business.

This section contains the steps you need to walk through to validate your general readiness for Teams.

Network Readiness Assessment
----------------------------

You must perform a *Network Readiness Assessment* before implementing any Real Time Communications product such as Microsoft Teams. A *Network Reading Assessment* focusses on network performance, network planning, and other general networking aspects such as ports and protocols that must be opened. Even if you are currently using a Real-Time Communications product, such as Skype for Business, the Network Readiness Assessment will help validate your network readiness.

A network readiness assessment can be found here: [Network Readiness Assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859069)

My Advisor
----------

Throughout your journey, you can also take advantage of the Practical Guidance available via My Advisor. My Advisor is a comprehensive self-service guide and toolset for planning and managing Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Online for operational success.

Quality Assessment
------------------

Before you start onboarding your users to Microsoft Teams, make sure that your current Skype for Business deployment meets the quality bar when it comes to real-time media. You may leverage various tools like Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) to monitor usage and identify quality trends and Call Analytics to troubleshoot or look at quality indicators of individual calls.

You can watch the CQD videos that provide guidance on how to use Call Quality Dashboard to Investigate media quality here: [CQD Videos](https://www.skypeoperationsframework.com/Academy?SOFTrainings=Leverage%20the%20Investigate%20Media%20Quality%20using%20CQD%20Videos)

Quality Champion Role
---------------------

Organizations should identify a person to take on the role of Quality Champion. The Quality Champion is accountable for reviewing quality metrics against usage, identifying quality trends and areas for improvement.

The Quality Champion role should be the go-to person for any call quality related issues and should act as the subject matter expert (SME) for the identification of quality issues by reviewing ongoing usage and quality trends and identifying action items. The Quality Champion role should work with the respective teams to drive remediation actions, reporting to a steering committee on the progress and open issues. The best candidate for the Quality Champion role is typically the customer service owner. Depending on the organization size and complexity, any person who is passionate about user experience and has the skills to identify trends can act as a Quality Champion, supported by the right level of sponsorship to work with other teams to drive remediation.

More information on the Quality Champion concept and the quality review tools and techniques can be found here: [Manage a quality and reliable service delivery workshop](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859071).

 Environmental Requirements
===========================

Teams combines multiple Office 365 services and is therefore dependent on the correct implementation and operation of these services. These services include but are not limited to; SharePoint Online, Exchange Online and OneDrive for Business.

While not all services are required it is highly recommended to implement them. If you choose to not implement certain services, this will impact the functionality that Teams can offer your organization. For example, while you are not required to implement SharePoint Online, Teams does rely on SharePoint Online for certain functionality such as file sharing in groups. Not implementing SharePoint Online will affect functionality offered through the client.

You can find out the requirements by completing the following checklist here: [Success With Teams/Getting Started](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859072)
