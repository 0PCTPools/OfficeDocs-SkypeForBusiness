To drive a successful Teams rollout in your organization, it’s important that you validate your network readiness. Preparing your current environment will help ensure a high-quality user experience now, in addition to improving the quality of the user experience in Teams. Taking time to plan individual steps can help accelerate your deployment and ensure that you haven’t skipped any important action items.

Complete these activities in parallel with your user readiness preparation:

- Verify that your environment meets all [prerequisites](plan-journey-prerequisites.md), and understand dependencies among Office 365 services and Teams.
- [Evaluate your environment](plan-journey-evaluate-environment.md) by performing environmental discovery by using a sample questionnaire to confirm your organization’s readiness to undertake a successful rollout journey to Teams.
- [Prepare your network](prepare-environment-prepare-network.md) through planning, preparation, and taking any necessary remediation steps for your network to support Teams workloads.
- [Prepare your service](prepare-environment-prepare-service.md) for rollout by using onboarding checklists to ensure that your Teams configuration is ready to support migrating your users to Teams.
