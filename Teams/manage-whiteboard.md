Manage the Whiteboard in Microsoft Teams
==========================================

Microsoft Whiteboard is a free-form, digital canvas where people, content, and ideas come together. Whiteboard integration in Microsoft Teams meetings is powered by the Whiteboard web app, which lets Teams meeting participants draw, sketch, and write together on a shared digital canvas.

Users can share a whiteboard to make it available to all participants in a Teams meeting. That same whiteboard is simultaneously available in all the Whiteboard applications on Windows 10, iOS, and the web app.

## Turn on or turn off the Whiteboard app

To turn on or turn off the Whiteboard web app, do the following steps:

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.

2. Go to **Settings** > **Services & add-ins**.

3. On the **Service & add-ins** page, scroll down, and then choose **Whiteboard**.

4. To turn on the Whiteboard app, on the **Whiteboard** pane, switch **Turn Whiteboard on or off for your entire organization** to **On**.

    To turn off the Whiteboard app, on the **Whiteboard** pane, switch **Turn Whiteboard on or off for your entire organization** to **Off**.

5. Click **Save**.
