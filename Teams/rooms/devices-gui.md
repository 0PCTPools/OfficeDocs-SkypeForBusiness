5. Navigate to the Users section in admin center and, in the Active Users list, select the room account you just created. In the right panel, you can see the account properties and several optional actions. Click the **Reset password** key icon under the username to change the password. Unselect **Make this user change their password when they first sign in**. It is not possible to change the password via the sign-in process on meeting room devices.
