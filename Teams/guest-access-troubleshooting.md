Removed from GA checklist:
## If your guests are seeing license errors

Guest access in Microsoft Teams uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Business to Business (B2B) and its licensing model. If youâ€™re seeing licensing errors, make sure to read the [B2B licensing guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/licensing-guidance) to understand the licensing requirements your organization has so that your users are able to invite guests to your organization.

A few things to remember:

- Guests are users outside your organization. Your employees, onsite contractors, onsite agents, and so on can't be added as guests. The same applies to your affiliates.
- Guest licenses are counted against the inviting organization. Consider this when you calculate the number of licenses you need.
- Licenses are counted against your organization whether the invited guests come from another Office 365 tenant or are using their personal email addresses.

## Understand the limitations for guests

The guest experience has limitations by design. Review [Understand the limitations for guests](guest-access.md#understand-the-limitations-for-guests) to be sure you're not trying to fix something that isn't a problem.
