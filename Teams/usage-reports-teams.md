View activity reports for Microsoft Teams 
=========================================

You can easily see how people in your business are using Office 365 services. For example, you can identify who is using a service a lot and reaching quotas, or who may not need an Office 365 license at all.

Reports are available for the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days. Data won't exist for all reporting periods right away. The reports become available within 48 hours.

The Web client performs browser version detection upon connecting to [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=855753) and if an unsupported browser version is detected, it will block access to the Web interface and recommend that the user download the desktop client or mobile app.

## How to get to the Reports dashboard

> [!NOTE]
> Safari isn't currently supported. Check the [Teams Roadmap](http://aka.ms/TeamsRoadmap) for news about new features in Teams. Users who try to open Teams on Safari will be directed to download the Teams desktop client.
