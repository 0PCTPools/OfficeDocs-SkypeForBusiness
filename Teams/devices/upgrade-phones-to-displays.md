# Upgrade IP phones to Teams displays

This article gives you an overview of how to upgrade your IP phones to Teams display devices in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

Teams displays are a category of all-in-one dedicated Teams devices that feature an ambient touchscreen and a hands-free experience powered by Cortana. To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams displays](teams-displays.md).

You can convert existing IP phones in your organization to Teams displays in the Microsoft Teams admin center. Doing this allows the device to provide a rich experience for your users as a Teams display device.

## Why upgrade to Teams displays?

In addition to [features supported by Teams phones](phones-for-teams.md#features-supported-by-teams-phones), Teams displays include the following features:

- **Dedicated displays for Teams** Users can access all core Teams features including chat, meetings, calls, teams and channels, files and more.
- **Ambient experience** Users can easily stay on top of their work with always-on and glanceable displays to see important activities and notifications without context-switching on their primary work device. Users can also personalize Teams displays by customizing the background through settings.
- **Hands-free with Cortana** Users can interact with Teams displays using their voice to effortlessly join and present in meetings, dictate replies to a Teams chat, check what’s on the calendar, and more.
