# Update Microsoft Teams devices remotely

Using the Microsoft Teams admin center, you can update your Teams devices, such as phones and collaboration bars, remotely.

## Manually update remote devices

When you update one or more devices using the admin center, you can decide whether to update the devices immediately or schedule an update for a future date and time. To open the manual update pane, do the following:

1. Sign in to Microsoft Teams admin center by visiting https://admin.teams.microsoft.com
2. Navigate  **Devices** > **Phones** or **Collaboration bars**
1. Select one or more devices and then select **Update**
1. Under **Manual updates**, select **Schedule** if you want to schedule the update for a future date and time. The updates will be applied at the date and time in the timezone selected in **Timezone**.

What you'll see depends on whether you have one device selected or multiple. The left image below shows multiple devices selected while the image on the right shows a single device selected.

When you select a single device, updates that are available for the device are shown. If multiple update types are available for the device, select each update type to install. You can view the **Current version** installed on the device and the **New version** that will be installed. Select the update(s) you want to apply and select **Update**.

When you select multiple devices, you can choose which types of updates to apply to each selected device. Select the update types you want to apply and select **Update**.

After you select **Update**, updates will be applied to your devices at the date and time you selected if you scheduled an update. If you didn't select a future date and time, updates will be applied to your devices within a few minutes.
