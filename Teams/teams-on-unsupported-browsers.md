# Teams meetings on unsupported browsers

Some browsers, such as Internet Explorer 11, Safari, and Firefox, support the Teams web app but do not support some of the Teams calling and meeting features. To work around this limitation, the Teams web app lets users receive audio through a PSTN connection and lets them view presented content (screen share) at a reduced display rate.

When Teams detects an unsupported browser, it automatically displays a message explaining the issue and the session limitations. The message provides further instructions for accessing the meeting audio, such as  advising the user to leave a call back number so that Teams can call the user, or instructing the user to call the conference number included in the meeting invitation. The message also encourages the user to download and use the [Teams desktop client](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads) for the full Teams experience.

> [!NOTE] 
> If the meeting invitation does not contain PSTN information (because of a tenant policy, for example), then the user sees a message that calling is not available for the meeting.

## Browser limitations

People who are using Teams web app on unsupported browsers will experience the following limitations:

- Audio is available through a PSTN connection only. Users can't use their microphone.
- Users can't share their camera or see other participants' videos, but are able to view presented content through image-based screen sharing.
- Users can't share their screen, although they can see a screen that another meeting participant shares.
- Users can't take control during a screen sharing session.
- Users won't receive incoming call notifications.
- If the call is interrupted, the meeting will not automatically reconnect.
