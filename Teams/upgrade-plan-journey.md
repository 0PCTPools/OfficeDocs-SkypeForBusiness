# Plan for your journey

A healthy technical environment, sustained user adoption, and the realization of your business goals all begin with proper planning. A solid plan gives you a framework for your upgrade project and ensures that all stakeholders are working toward the same goals. By taking time to properly define success, you can measure results as you progress through your deployment and verify that you’re achieving the outcomes you wanted. Planning your journey includes:

-   Enlisting your project stakeholders

-   Scoping your project

## Enlist your project stakeholders

From implementing project deliverables to driving accountability, your stakeholders hold the keys to project success. There are two groups of stakeholders you’ll want to assign: (1) a *sponsorship coalition* inclusive of executive and project sponsors that have a vested interest and influence in project success, and (2) the *project team* consisting of technical and user readiness members who will be completing the various tasks associated with the project plan. The common thread between these two groups is the *project manager,* who works to ensure project tasks get completed on schedule and reports project status back to the coalition.

Tip: Take time to identity the ideal Executive Sponsor, someone who helps set the tone of your project, leads by example and holds others accountable. This should be a senior manager or executive who has authority over the project scope and vision. They should also be the final decision maker in removing blockers and resolving conflict to help keep the project on time and on budget.

*Optional: Create a steering committee*. Sometimes large or more complex projects end up with ‘too many cooks in the kitchen’, resulting in disconnects between the stakeholder groups. For these projects, you may elect to form a steering committee. A steering committee is responsible for driving decisions, providing strategic oversight, supporting the project’s initiatives, and—when necessary—removing blockers. More information on implementing a steering committee can be found in the [steering committee guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/envision-steering-committee-complete-guide).

## Scope your project

Taking time to define your project vision, scope, goals and governance will help ensure all project stakeholders are aligned and working toward the same end results. This is especially critical given that the technical readiness team and user readiness team will be working independently to pull their respective pieces together. Once you complete this section, refer to it throughout your project to ensure you are on track for your desired end-state. Use the goals section to measure against your outcomes and mitigate as needed.

### Project Vision

Your vision is the “big picture” or long-term end-state
answering the question, “Why are we doing this project?” An ideal vision
addresses your **organization’s business drivers** as well as **end user
value-add** perspectives. As an example:

>   *Organization Business Driver:* Standardizing on Microsoft Teams aligns with
>   our digital workplace transformation and enables us to drive operational
>   efficiencies, eliminate redundant solutions and save \$5 million dollars.

>   *End User Value-Add:* Microsoft Teams (1) saves time by providing a single
>   location for project notes, Office docs, team members, conversations AND
>   meetings; (2) Simplifies communication with a centralized contact list and
>   persistent chat tracking for quick access to your conversations and (3)
>   Alleviates frustration of trying to find that lost email attachment by
>   storing and accessing files in one place.

Consider the following discussion points to help define your vision:

-   Description of the current business process

-   Challenges with the existing business process

-   How technology can help overcome these challenges

-   The expected and measurable business outcomes if these challenges are
    overcome

> [!TIP]
> Identify *use cases* and *personas* to further refine your project vision.

### Project Scope

Your long-term vision may be realized over time and through
various phases. The project scope defines the focus of your project *at this
time* and serves to keep your project team focused on the current tasks,
enabling you to realize your long-term vision**.** For example, your scope might
be to run a pilot, deploy a specific workload such as Voice or Meetings, or to
enable Teams alongside Skype for Business as you plan for your upgrade over
time. As part of the project scope, you should consider assessing:

-   The best way for both Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams to coexist;
    prior to your move to Teams.

-   [The various
    modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams)
    available and determine the optimal path for your organization.

-   The need to conduct a *pilot* to validate technical and user readiness
    within your organization.

### Project Goals

Your goals define the intended outcome and enable you to
measure success of the project. Goals can be defined as objectives and key
results (OKRs), and the measures of project success can be defined as a list of
key success indicators (KSIs). Full participation from project stakeholders in
defining OKRs and KSIs is essential to help ensure they feel a sense of
ownership and to align these measures of success to defined project tasks. Goals
should include a mix of technical and user-focused success.

**OKRs** contain the *objectives* you set in the beginning of the project, and the *key results* you measure on a defined cadence (e.g. monthly, quarterly). Reviewing your key results enables you to ensure your project deliverables are on schedule or identify/mitigate issues to get your project back on track. OKRs are typically measured as Achieved or Not Achieved.

**KSIs** measure quality and success of the key results and complement the binary nature of OKRs by detailing good and/or bad results. When defining KSIs, we recommend that you use “specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, time-related” (SMART) criteria:

-   Specific: target a specific area for improvement
-   Measurable: quantify, or at least suggest an indicator of, progress
-   Assignable: specify who will do it
-   Realistic: state what results can realistically be achieved, given available
    resources
-   Time-related: specify when the results can be achieved

Below are examples of OKRs and KSIs for the initial phases of a Skype for
Business to Teams upgrade project.

> [!TIP]
> To help ensure your project remains on track, consider defining both smaller short-term milestones and bigger long-term goals. This includes metrics that you will capture as part of your *user pilot*. When considering your timeline, leverage the [Skype to Teams roadmap](https://skypeandteams.blob.core.windows.net/artefacts/Skype%20for%20Business%20to%20Teams%20Capabilities%20Roadmap.pdf) if you are waiting on certain features not yet available in Teams.

### Risks and Mitigation

With any project, unforeseen factors may arise and throw your project off track. Proactively assessing potential risks and defining a mitigation plan will help overcome issues that may arise, enabling your project to continue toward your goals. A *risk register* is an excellent tool to track Project Risk, Risk Likelihood, Risk Impact and documenting your Mitigation Plan. Here is a sample risk register:

| Risk                   | Likelihood | Impact | Overall | Mitigation Plan                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|------------|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Quality**    | Medium     | High   | High    | Execute network planning exercise                                                                                                     |
| **Low User adoption**  | High       | High   | High    | Proactively work with users during pilot and deployment phases; Implement a targeted awareness and training campaign to create desire |
|                        |            |        |         |                                                                                                                                       |

### Governance

The final step in planning is to agree on the governance model for your Teams deployment. This includes things like who can create teams, what policies and processes can you implement to help users optimize Teams, are there features that need to be considered for compliance? Taking time to define your governance model for Teams can help drive a positive user experience while faciliating the management of Teams with IT and your support desk. If your organization already has a governance board, engage them as part of your project stakeholder team and align Teams policies and processes with other operational models already in place. 

Link to the Teams governance page.

Once you have completed the above activities, you should have a solid foundation for your project. Continue with your technical readiness and organizational readiness planning activities.
