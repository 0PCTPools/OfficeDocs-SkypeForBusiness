# Plan for your journey

A healthy technical environment, sustained user adoption, and the realization of your business goals all begin with proper planning. A solid plan gives you a framework for your upgrade project and ensures that all stakeholders are working toward the same goals. By taking time to properly define success, you can measure results as you progress through your deployment and verify that you’re achieving the outcomes you wanted. Planning your journey includes:

-   Enlisting your project stakeholders

-   Scoping your project

## Enlist your project stakeholders

From implementing project deliverables to driving accountability, your stakeholders hold the key to the success of your project. There are two groups of stakeholders you’ll want to assign: (1) a _sponsorship coalition_ that includes executive and project sponsors who have a vested interest in and influence on the project’s success, and (2) the _project team_, consisting of the people responsible for ensuring technical and user readiness, who will complete the various tasks in the project plan. The common thread between these two groups is the _project manager_, who works to ensure that project tasks get completed on schedule and reports project status back to the coalition.

> [!Tip]
> Take time to identify the ideal executive sponsor, someone who can help set the tone of your project, leads by example, and holds others accountable. This should be a senior manager or executive who has authority over the project scope and vision. They should also be the final decision-maker in removing blockers and resolving conflict to help keep the project on time and on budget.

Optionally, you can create a steering committee. Sometimes large or more complex projects end up with “too many cooks in the kitchen,” resulting in disconnects among the stakeholder groups. For these projects, you might want to form a steering committee. A steering committee is responsible for driving decisions, providing strategic oversight, supporting the project’s initiatives, and—when necessary—removing blockers. You can find more information about implementing a steering committee in the     [steering committee guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/envision-steering-committee-complete-guide).

## Scope your project

Taking time to define your project vision, scope, goals, and governance will help ensure all project stakeholders are aligned and working toward the same end results. This is especially critical given that the technical readiness team and user readiness team will be working independently to pull their respective pieces together. After you complete this section, refer to it throughout your project to ensure you’re on track to achieve the end state you wanted. Use the goals that you identify below to measure against your outcomes, and mitigate as needed.

### Project vision

Your vision is the “big picture” or eventual end-state that answers the question, “Why are we doing this project?” An ideal vision addresses your organization’s business drivers and user value-add perspectives, as shown in the following examples:

-   **Organization business driver**: Standardizing on Microsoft Teams aligns with our digital workplace transformation and enables us to drive operational efficiencies, eliminate redundant solutions, and save USD5 million.
-    **User value-add**: Microsoft Teams (1) saves time by providing a single location for project notes, Office docs, team members, conversations, and meetings; (2) simplifies communication by using a centralized contact list and persistent chat tracking for quick access to your conversations, and (3) alleviates the frustration of trying to find that lost email attachment by storing and accessing files in one place.

Consider the following discussion points to help refine your vision:

-   Description of the current business process

-   Challenges with the existing business process

-   How technology can help overcome these challenges

-   The expected and measurable business outcomes if these challenges are overcome

> [!TIP]
> Identify *use cases* and *personas* to further refine your project vision.

### Project scope

Your vision might only be realized over time, through various phases. The project scope defines the focus of your project at this time and serves to keep your project team focused on their current tasks, enabling you to realize your long-term vision. For example, your scope might call for you to run a pilot, deploy a specific workload such as voice or meetings, or enable Teams alongside Skype for Business as you plan for your upgrade over time. As part of the project scope, you should assess:
[//]: # (Will pilot-essentials be gutted and filled with new content, or should it be net new?)

-   The best way for Skype for Business and Teams to coexist before you move to Teams.
-   [The various modes](upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams.md), and which would be optimal for your organization.
-   Whether you should conduct a [pilot](pilot-essentials.md) to validate technical and user readiness in your organization.

### Project goals

Your goals define the outcome you want and enable you to measure the success of the project. Goals can be defined as _objectives and key results_ (OKRs), and the measures of project success can be defined as _key success indicators_ (KSIs). It’s essential that you get full participation from project stakeholders in defining OKRs and KSIs, to help ensure they feel a sense of ownership and align these measures of success to defined project tasks. Goals should include a mix of technical and user-focused success. 

-   **OKRs** contain the objectives you set at the beginning of the project and the key results you measure on a defined cadence (for example, monthly or quarterly). By reviewing your key results, you can ensure your project deliverables are on schedule, or identify and mitigate issues to get your project back on track. OKRs are typically categorized as “achieved” or “not achieved.”
-    **KSIs** measure quality and success of the key results and complement the binary nature of OKRs by detailing good and/or bad results. When defining KSIs, we recommend that you use “specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, time-related” (SMART) criteria:
    -   Specific: target a specific area for improvement
    -   Measurable: quantify, or at least suggest an indicator of, progress
    -   Assignable: specify who will do it
    -   Realistic: state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources
    -   Time-related: specify when the results can be achieved

The following table shows examples of OKRs and KSIs for the initial phases of a Skype for Business to Teams upgrade project.

> [!TIP]
> To help ensure your project stays on track, consider defining smaller, short-term milestones in addition to bigger, long-term goals. This can include metrics that you’ll capture as part of your user pilot. When considering your timeline, use the [Skype to Teams roadmap](https://skypeandteams.blob.core.windows.net/artefacts/Skype%20for%20Business%20to%20Teams%20Capabilities%20Roadmap.pdf) if you’re waiting for features that aren’t yet available in Teams.

### Risks and mitigation

 With any project, unforeseen events or other factors can arise and throw your project off track. It’s important to proactively assess potential risks and define a mitigation plan for overcoming the issues that might arise, so your project can continue toward your goals. A _risk register_ is an excellent tool for tracking project risks—along with how likely they are and their potential impact—and capturing your mitigation plan. The following table shows a sample risk register.

| Risk                   | Likelihood | Impact | Overall | Mitigation plan                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|------------|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network quality**    | Medium     | High   | High    | Execute a network planning exercise.                                                                                                     |
| **Low user adoption**  | High       | High   | High    | Proactively work with users during the pilot and deployment phases; implement a targeted awareness and training campaign to create desire. |
|                        |            |        |         |                                                                                                                                       |

### Governance

The final step in planning is to agree on the governance model for your Teams deployment. This includes questions like who can create teams, what policies and processes can you implement to help users optimize Teams, are there features that need to be considered for compliance? Taking time to define your governance model for Teams can help drive a positive user experience while facilitating the management of Teams with IT and your support desk. If your organization already has a governance board, engage them as part of your project stakeholder team and align Teams policies and processes with operational models that are already in place.

For more information, see the [Teams governance page].

After you’ve completed the activities described above, you should have a solid foundation for your project. Continue with your technical readiness and organizational readiness planning activities.
