# Get started with Microsoft Teams for remote learning

Microsoft Teams is a platform that brings conversations, content, assignments, and apps together in one place. Build collaborative classrooms, connect in professional learning communities, and connect with colleagues â€“ all from a single experience.

Use the best practices in this article to start using Microsoft Teams for your educational needs to enable remote learning capabilities. Microsoft Teams can be used to enable class collaboration engaging students in conversations, providing a virtual meeting platform, and distributing assignments. School administrators and staff can stay up-to-date and collaborate using Teams for announcements and topical conversations. Educators can share instructional material using Professional Learning Communities.

Microsoft Teams has [clients](get-clients.md) available for desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux), web, and mobile (Android and iOS) to make sure all your staff and students can stay connected.

## User accounts, licenses, and identity security

Microsoft Teams leverages Microsoft 365 capabilities to authenticate users and provide services. Staff, instructors, and students should have identities established to facilitate collaboration. If identities do not already exist, follow this process to establish them.

[Teams licenses need to be enabled for users](user-access.md) before they can start using Teams capabilities. Teams relies on additional Microsoft 365 capabilities such as [Office 365 groups](Office-365-groups.md), [Exchange](Exchange-Teams-interact.md), [SharePoint and OneDrive](SharePoint-OneDrive-interact.md) to enable collaborative scenarios. Users receive the best Teams experience if all these services are also enabled. [Teams is supported for users who have email hosted by Google](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/education/deploy/enabling-teams-for-education-for-google-users).
