Select users for your Teams pilot 
==================================

A successful pilot validates how Microsoft Teams will be used on a daily basis
by your users. This helps you understand who your users are, how they
communicate and collaborate, and which features will help optimize their
productivity.

The pilot should include key people in various departments who represent a
variety of roles. At the same time, it should include a reasonable number of
users so that project management resources can handle the amount of feedback the
pilot will generate.

There are three core attributes of optimal pilot user selection:

-   **Personas (the “who”):** The categorization of users who benefit from the
    collaboration scenarios that Teams supports. By using a persona assessment,
    you can enlist a good cross-section of the different roles in your
    organization to represent users in your pilot deployment.

-   **Use cases and scenarios (the “how”):** Using features during day-to-day
    activities. You can use relevant scenarios to build your pilot test plans.

-   **Functionality (the “what”):** Individual features in Teams. You can assess
    the Teams roadmap to define your pilot phases based on the availability of
    features that are already included in Teams or will be introduced later.

Perform user persona assessment
-------------------------------

The user persona assessment, built on eight core personas commonly found in
organizations, helps you categorize your users based on their communication and
collaboration requirements. This helps you narrow down the list of users you’ll
select for the pilot as you plan for your broad rollout of Teams over time.

Map use cases to your personas
------------------------------

When it comes to communication and collaboration, there are four common types of
interactions: conversations, meetings, team and project collaboration, and
at-scale communications. During this assessment, you need to define how your
organization maps to each one, as it relates to your journey from Skype for
Business to Teams.

Sample scenarios for each interaction type are provided below. Use these samples
as a starting point, and map your organization’s use cases to these scenarios
for your journey to Teams.

### Scenario 01 – Conversations (ad hoc)

**Scenario theme:** Accelerate communications to maintain project momentum and
build rapport.

**Sample use cases:**

**Common characteristics:**

-   One on one, or few participants

-   Ad-hoc, as needed

-   Brief and interactive

-   Chat-driven or phone call–driven

### Scenario 02—Meetings

**Scenario theme:** Facilitate discussions and dissemination of information
through interactive conversation and brainstorming.

**Sample use cases:**

**Common characteristics:**

-   Point-in-time meetings with defined agendas

-   Synchronous communication

-   Defined audience, can be internal and external

-   Scheduled in advance

-   Real-time content sharing

-   Multiple presenters or contributors

### Scenario 03 – Collaboration

**Scenario theme:** Expedite information-sharing and simplify information
accessibility to drive team activity and productivity.

**Sample use cases:**

**Common characteristics:**

-   Project-related or team-related efforts

-   Defined audiences, local and remote (worldwide) vTeams

-   Add new team members over time, need to quickly onboard

-   Persistent access to files, conversation, and apps

-   Synchronous or asynchronous communication (chats, meetings)

### Scenario 04 – At-scale communications

**Scenario theme:** Broadcast a message in a structured and professional manner
to a large group of participants.

**Sample use cases:**

**Common characteristics:**

-   Defined or open audience

-   Structured format

-   Scheduled in advance

-   One-way dissemination of information

-   Managed participants (Q&A, audio)

    Define 5–10 use cases to serve as a guideline for your pilot users.

-   Identify and note your pilot users.

> [!Important]
> Review the [Teams roadmap](https://aka.ms/skype2teamsroadmap) when you define your pilot phases and users. Ensure that your users don’t depend on any feature that hasn’t been released yet.

### Create a test plan

After you’ve defined and documented your personas and use cases, the next step is validating that your organization’s expectations and requirements are met through feature, functionality, and usability. You should perform this validation step before you complete the final deployment in your production environment.

A sample test plan for the pilot rollout is provided below. Use the scenarios and personas described earlier in this article to customize this plan and make it relevant for your pilot users. We recommend that you include the scenario in your email communication so that the pilot tester can apply a real-world use case to their testing, versus just running through a series of features.
