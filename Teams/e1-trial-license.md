Manage the Office 365 E1 Trial
==============================

New in March 2020, the Office 365 E1 Trial is a free 6-month E1 license that will help you turn on Microsoft Teams for any users in your organization that don't have it. Microsoft is making this special E1 Trial license available in response to the increased need for employees to work from home (WFH) in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak. 

To learn what's available with the E1 license, read [Office 365 E1](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/office-365-enterprise-e1-business-software).

## How to get an E1 Trial license

Contact your Microsoft account representative. They'll get you a promo code that you can use to sign up for the E1 Trial. 

## How to sign up for E1

Click the promo code in the email your account rep will send you. 


## Who's eligible?

Anyone who hasn't already activated any other Office 365 E1 trials. 

Anyone who doesn't have an Office 365 license that includes Teams for everyone in their organization. If some people do and some people don't have an Office 365 license that includes Teams, you can use the E1 Trial for the people who don't yet have Teams.

## Who isn't eligible

Your organization isn't eligible for this offer if you're a GCC, GCC High, DoD, or EDU customer.

## Manage the Teams Exploratory experience

Once you've activated the Office 365 E1 Trial, turn on the license for any uses who need it. To learn how, read [Manage user access to Teams](user-access.md#manage-teams-through-the-microsoft-365-admin-center).


Once you've turned on the E1 Trial for the users who need it, you'll manage these users just like you manage users who have a paid license. For more information, see [Manage Teams settings for your organization](enable-features-office-365.md).



### Upgrade users from the Office 365 E1 Trial license

To upgrade E1 Trial users to a paid subscription:

1. Purchase a subscription that includes Teams.

2. Remove the Office 365 E1 Trial subscription from the user.

3. Assign the newly purchased license.

For more information, see [Office 365 licensing for Microsoft Teams](Office-365-licensing.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If the E1 Trial license ends and a user is not immediately upgraded to a subscription that includes Teams, the user data is not removed. The user still exists in Azure Active Directory and all data within Teams still remains. Once a new license is assigned to the user to enable Teams functionality again, all content will still exist. 

### Remove an Office 365 E1 Trial license
