# About Upgrade Essentials 

Designed for smaller organizations or those using Skype for Business Online for
IM (chat) and meetings only, *Upgrade Essentials* is an accelerated action plan
that includes core, recommend activities and associated resources for
implementing a successful move from Skype for Business to Teams.

These ten easy steps provide everything you need for upgrade success. Note: The
timeline provided is an approximation and should be adjusted based on your
organization’s upgrade timeline.

>   *Not familiar with Teams*? [Microsoft
>   Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)
>   brings together conversations, meetings, files, Office apps, and third-party
>   integrations— providing a single hub for teamwork in Office 365.

>   *Have questions about your upgrade*? View our *FAQ.*

## Upgrade Essentials Ten-Step Checklist

## &#9744; Step 1. Notify your key stakeholders. (Approx. 4-6 weeks prior to your upgrade)

>   Senior leaders are accountable for company success and should be kept
>   in-the-know about technology changes. As not everyone may have received or
>   read the notification of upgrade eligibility, be sure to inform your
>   stakeholders (e.g. CEO, IT Pros, Marketing and Help Desk Leads) prior to
>   beginning upgrade planning.

## &#9744; Step 2. Envision your organization on Teams. (Approx. 4-6 weeks prior to your upgrade)

>   Teams offers compatible Skype for Business functionality such as IM (Chat)
>   and Meetings, but it can also do so much more. As a true hub for teamwork,
>   Teams enables workgroups to manage projects, files, conversations and apps
>   all in one location. Decide how your organization will utilize Teams and
>   enable your environment for success.

>   Note: As an existing Skype for Business customer, your current network
>   infrastructure is likely configured for Teams. (Optional) Leverage the
>   Complete technical planning link below to confirm enablement.

>   **Resources:**

-   [Overview of
    Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/Teams-overview)

    channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-channels-overview)

-   [Complete technical
    planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/quick-start-enable-teams#step-3-complete-technical-planning)

## &#9744; Step 3. Know your Skype for Business users. (Approx. 4 weeks prior to your upgrade)

>   Users who are deeply adopted on Skype for Business may need a little more
>   time or assistance to make the transition to Teams. Take time to review your
>   current Skype for Business usage to identify your top users who may need
>   additional support as well as establish a usage baseline you can track
>   against post-upgrade.

## &#9744; Step 4. Notify your users that Skype for Business is becoming Teams. (Approx. 2-3 weeks prior to your upgrade)

>   Providing ample notice to your users will afford them time to get familiar
>   with Teams without greatly impacting their productivity, resulting in a more
>   positive user experience. Send a communication to inform users of what’s
>   changing, why it’s changing and what actions they need to take to prepare.

>   NOTE: If needed, enable Teams for your users via the O365 Admin Portal, at
>   this time.

-   [Sample email verbiage](#step-4-notify-users-email)

## &#9744; Step 5. Activate the user upgrade notification. (Approx. 1 week prior to your upgrade)

>   Maintain upgrade momentum by enabling the user upgrade notification via the
>   Admin portal, providing a visual alert (in the Skype for Business client)
>   that Skype for Business is becoming Teams. Note: For eligible tenants,
>   Microsoft can also activate this on your behalf.

>   **Resources:**

-   Link to guidance - Irinel?

## &#9744; Step 6. Remind your users that Skype for Business is becoming Teams. (Approx. 5 days prior to your upgrade)

>   Users are busy with their daily responsibilities. Reminding users of the
>   pending upgrade will help ensure they remember to take the necessary steps
>   to prepare for Teams. This is the perfect time to remind users about
>   available training and how to get started with Teams.

## &#9744; Step 7. Upgrade users to Teams! (Upgrade Day)

>   Today is the day your organization officially upgrades to Teams as your
>   communication and collaboration solution. In the O365 Admin Portal, activate
>   the upgrade switch. Users will receive a notification in their Skype for
>   Business client that they have been upgraded to Teams. Note: For eligible
>   tenants, Microsoft can upgrade your tenant on your behalf.

>   Recommended: Once upgraded, send an email welcoming everyone to Teams.

>   **Resources:**

-   Link to upgrade users instructions – Irinel? – waiting on release of feature
    and documentation

-   [Sample email verbiage](#step-7-welcome-users-email)

## &#9744; Step 8. Monitor Teams usage against your baseline. (Approx. 1-2 weeks post upgrade)

>   Adjusting to a new technology may take some time. Check your usage to verify
>   users are utilizing Teams at the same/greater level as they were with Skype
>   for Business. Check in with users who aren’t using Teams at expected levels.

>   **Resources:**

-   [See Usage data](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/reportsUsage)

## &#9744; Step 9. Measure user satisfaction. (Approx. 1-2 weeks post)

>   Employee satisfaction can influence productivity, retention and ultimately
>   business outcomes. Reach out to your users to gauge user sentiment with the
>   upgrade and with Teams.

>   **Resources:**

-   [Sample verbiage](#step-9-check-in-user-email), plus [user
    survey](#sample-feedback-survey-for-the-check-in-email)

## &#9744; Step 10. Maximize your ROI with Teams. (ongoing/post upgrade)

>   Once users are comfortable with IM (chat) and meetings in Teams, encourage
>   users to extend their use case with Teams collaboration and app integration,
>   truly optimizing their new solution and maximizing a return on your
>   investment.
