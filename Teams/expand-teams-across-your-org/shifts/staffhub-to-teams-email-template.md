# StaffHub to Teams email template

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We’re building StaffHub capabilities into Microsoft Teams. Today, Teams includes the Shifts app for schedule management and additional capabilities will roll out over time. StaffHub will stop working for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who tries to open StaffHub will be shown a message directing them to download Teams. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired.md). 

Making the transition from StaffHub to Teams begins when you start preparing for the change. To help ensure your move to Teams is successful, we've created a sample email that you can use to communicate the change across your organization. Use this as part of your onboarding strategy to spread the word about Shifts and the transition to Teams, raise awareness, and drive adoption across your organization.

## Sample email

> Subject: Move to Shifts in Microsoft Teams<br>
> To: StaffHub team managers and teams

***
Over the next few weeks you will see new functionality rolled out by <Contoso IT>. This new functionality will enable you to use Microsoft Teams so that you can chat, collaborate and view your shift schedules through Teams. 

The Shifts app in Microsoft Teams will is replacing Microsoft StaffHub as your schedule management tool and soon access to StaffHub will no longer be available. The Shifts app experience in Microsoft Teams It should be very similar to your current scheduling experience in StaffHub and should be a smooth transition.

**Next steps**

You don’t need to take any action now. The IT department will move all your scheduling data from StaffHub to the Shifts app in Teams, and starting <date>, you will begin using Microsoft Teams instead of Microsoft StaffHub to access your shift schedules.  

Be on the lookout for more emails from <Contoso IT> that will let you know when you can start using this functionality in addition to guidance on how to manage your shifts and collaborate in Microsoft Teams.
