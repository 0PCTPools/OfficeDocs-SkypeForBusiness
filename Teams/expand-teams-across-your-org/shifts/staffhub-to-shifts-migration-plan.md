# Plan and prepare to move your StaffHub teams to Shifts in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. Weâ€™re building StaffHub capabilities into Microsoft Teams. Today, Teams includes the Shifts app for schedule management and additional capabilities will roll out over time. StaffHub will stop working for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who tries to open StaffHub will be shown a message directing them to download Teams. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired.md).
