# STU3 interface specification

[!INCLUDE [preview-feature](../../includes/preview-feature.md)]

The FHIR server must support POST requests using bundles for the following resources:

- [Patient](#patient)
- [Observation](#observation)
- [Condition](#condition)
- [Encounter](#encounter)
- [Allergy Intolerance](#allergyintolerance)
- [Coverage](#coverage)
- [Medication Statement](#medication-request) (replaces the MedicationOrder in the DSTU2 version of the PatientsApp)
- Location (the information needed from this resource can be included in Encounter)

> [!NOTE]
> The Patient resource is the only mandatory resource (without which the app will not load at all); However, it is recommended that the Partner implement support for all the above mentioned resources per specifications provided below for the best end-user experience with the Microsoft Teams Patients App.

Queries from the Patient App for more than one resource shall post a bundle (BATCH) of requests to the FHIR server's URL. The server shall process each request and return a bundle of the resources matched by each request. For more information and examples, see [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction).

## Capability Statement

See [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/capabilitystatement.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/capabilitystatement.html).

These are the minimum required fields:

1. Rest
   1. Mode
   2. Interaction
   3. Resource: Type
   4. Security: [Extension for OAuth URIs](http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-oauth-uris.html)
2. FhirVersion (Our code requires this to understand which version we should pivot to.)

## Patient 

See [http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient.html](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient.html).

Here are the minimum required fields, a subset of the Argonaut patient profile fields:

1. Name.Given
2. Name.Family
3. Gender
4. BirthDate
5. MRN (Identifier)

In addition to the [Argonaut fields](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-patient.html), for a great user experience, we can also read the following field(s):

1. Name.Use
2. Name.Prefix
3. [GeneralPractitioner] - The GeneralPractitioner reference should be included in the Patient resource (display field only)

Resource search using POST method at /Patient/_search and the following parameters:

1. id
2. family=(searches for all patients whose family name contains the value)
3. given=\<substring>
4. birthdate=(exact match)
5. gender=(values being one of the administrative-gender)
6. \_count (maximum number of results that should be returned) <br> The response should contain the total count of records returned as a result of the search and \_count will be used by the PatientsApp to limit the number of records returned.
7. identifier=\<mrn>

The goal is to be able to search and filter for a patient by the following:

- ID: This is the resource ID that every resource in FHIR has.
- MRN: This is the actual identifier for the patient that clinical staff would know. We understand this MRN is based on the type of identifier inside the identifier resource in FHIR
- Name
- Birthdate

See the following example call.
