# Setting up secure messaging in Health - notebook page

Secure messaging is valuable in a Healthcare context, where a message arriving and being acted upon can truly be a matter of life and death. Teams supports secure messaging in the following ways:

- When enabled by the administrator, users can set a priority for chat messages sent to other users. This can help the message recipient quickly see what needs immediate attention and what is "nice-to-know."
- When enabled by an administrator, if a user sends a message and requests it, they will be notified when the recipient reads the message.
- Message Delegate is a messaging feature allowing
- Pin a Post is a new feature allowing 
- @mention in chat
- Role Based Directory
- Message Escalate
- Message Forward
- #tag or tag conversations for patient centric messaging
- message anyone (sms integration)
- Custom Mobile Compose Tray

Both of these settings are available in the Microsoft Teams admin center as options in a Messaging policy.

Priority Messaging is a healthcare verticals feature designed to help hospital staff alert one other when a critical incident requires their attention. Unlike regular “important” messages, priority messaging repeatedly notifies users for a period of 20 minutes or until messages are picked up and read by the recipient. The key goal of the feature is to maximize the likelihood that the message is picked up and acted upon in a timely manner.
