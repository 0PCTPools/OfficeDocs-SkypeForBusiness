# Patients app overview

The Patients application is a Microsoft Teams store app available to all Teams users. The app enables patient care teams consisting of clinical workers (e.g. Nurses, physicians, social workers) can curate and review lists of patients for scenarios ranging from rounds and interdisciplinary team meetings to general patient monitoring.   

The app has two modes: 

- The EMR Connected mode that connects to EMRs through FHIR. 
- The manual mode that enables care teams to manually add/bring in patient information. 


## Usage example

During rounding sessions on every shift in medical wards, clinicians gather at the nursing station to discuss the latest updates on the progress with patients in the ward.  They highlight the key critical metrics (not necessarily medical or that its explicit on the patientsâ€™ medical records) and ensure the patient is on the right glide path to discharge based on their diagnosis.  The rounding session includes clinicians that are there in person where they can share the information from the Patients app on a large screen display or that they can be joining remotely through an online meeting.
