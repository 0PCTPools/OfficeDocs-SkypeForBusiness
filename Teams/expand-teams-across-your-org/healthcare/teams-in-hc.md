# Get started with Teams for Healthcare organizations

Microsoft Teams offers a number of features useful for hospitals and other Healthcare organizations. Teams features are under development to aid hospitals with:

- Care coordination and collaboration
- Secure Messaging
- Virtual Visit
- Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) integration
- Firstline Worker system integration

The content in this section builds on the foundational capabilities of Teams, such as meetings, calling, and messaging, and assumes that you've already deployed Teams in your organization. If you haven't yet rolled out Teams, start by reading [How to roll out Microsoft Teams](../../How-to-roll-out-teams.md).

## Care coordination and collaboration using the Lists app

> [!NOTE]
> Effective October 30, 2020, the Patients app has been retired and replaced by the [Lists app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db) in Teams. With Lists, care teams in your healthcare organization can create patient lists for scenarios ranging from rounds and interdisciplinary team meetings to general patient monitoring.

The Lists app in Teams helps teams track information and organize work. The app is pre-installed for all Teams users and is available as a tab in every team and channel. Lists can be created from scratch, from predefined templates, or by importing data to Excel.

Care teams can use the Patients template to get started. They can create lists to track the needs and status of patients. Existing patient data on Excel spreadsheets can be brought in to create a list in Teams. These lists can be used for scenarios such as rounds and patient monitoring to coordinate care.

For example, a charge nurse creates a patient list in a team that includes all care team members. During rounds, the care team access Teams on their mobile devices and update patient information in the list, which everyone on the team can view to stay in sync. At rounding sessions where the care team gathers to discuss and evaluate key health performance metrics to ensure a patient is on the right glide path to discharge, they can share this information using Teams on a large display screen. Care team members who aren't on site can join remotely.

Here's an example list which was set up for patient rounding.

To learn more, see [Manage the Lists app for your organization in Teams](../../manage-lists-app.md).

## Teams templates

New templates for creating Teams were developed to apply to a hospital setting, and more are expected soon. This makes it easier to create teams that Healthcare workers use to coordinate care for patients in various departments or wards. See [Get started with Teams templates for Healthcare organizations](healthcare-templates.md). Teams can be started for internal departments such as cardiology, or for care wards, and more templates are in development.

## Secure Messaging

Secure messaging supports collaboration within care teams, including several new features:

- A message sender can set a special priority for their message, so the recipient is repeatedly notified until they read the message.
- A message sender can request a read receipt, so they are notified when a message they sent was read by the message recipient.

Together, these features allow quicker attention to urgent messages and confidence that the message was received and read. New care teams using these features can be created on a per-patient basis. These features are policy-based, and can be assigned to individuals or entire Teams.

See [Get started with Secure Messaging policies for Healthcare organizations](messaging-policies-hc.md) for further details.

Also related to secure messaging is the ability to have other tenants federated by Healthcare organizations, allowing richer inter-tenant communication. (See [Manage external access (federation) in Microsoft Teams](../../manage-external-access.md)).

## Firstline Worker integration

Microsoft Teams integrates with Firstline Worker, which can be used to coordinate shift staffing features and more. See [Manage the Shifts app for your organization in Microsoft Teams](../shifts/manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams.md).
