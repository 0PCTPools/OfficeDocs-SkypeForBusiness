   Create collaborative classrooms, connect in professional learning communities, and communicate with school staff and students all from a single experience with Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education.

    Watch the "Introducing classroom experiences in Microsoft Teams" video (2:33 minutes).
    > [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7uiMs4dPcg]

 
    This guide is for IT Admins who haven't yet deployed Microsoft Teams. It will help you understand how to enable Teams for your school, help you plan your deployment, and help you understand overall considerations, such as whether you should run a pilot program before you widely launch Teams. 

    The guide is designed to get you started quickly. For more detailed and comprehensive guidance, see [Overview of Microsoft Teams](Teams-overview.md).

    If you have already deployed Teams (pilot or full) and are looking for pointers on how to use Teams, see [Microsoft Teams for Education Quick Start](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Microsoft-Teams-5aa4431a-8a3c-4aa5-87a6-b6401abea114).
  
    ## Before you begin
    
    1. Configure the correct ports and protocols for Microsoft Teams. See [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](office-365-urls-ip-address-ranges.md).
    2. Prepare your school's network for Microsoft Teams. See [Prepare your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](prepare-network.md).
    3. Choose a team type. Microsoft Teams in EDU offers you three new types of teams (for a total of four). To understand the differences and use cases of each, see [Choose a team type to collaborate in Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-a-team-type-to-collaborate-in-Microsoft-Teams-0a971053-d640-4555-9fd7-f785c2b99e67).

    You can manage individual user licenses for Microsoft Teams by using the Office 365 admin center or through PowerShell. See [Office 365 licensing for Microsoft Teams](office-365-licensing.md) to see how to accomplish this in either method. This will be valuable to understand if you are interested in piloting Teams before rolling it out to your entire institution. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Before you enable Teams for your entire institution, you should  make sure you have the proper controls in place. A pilot program will help significantly to ensure the proper users are able to use and give feedback on what types of controls will enhance the usage and management of the product. If you are looking for guidance on how to plan and run a pilot program, see [Pilot Microsoft Teams alongside Skype for Business](pilot-essentials.md). The concepts are still valid and valuable even if you aren't currently running Skype for Business.

    Use the Office 365 admin center to manage Microsoft Teams for your school.

    1. From the Office 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Services & add-ins**.
    2. On the **Services & add-ins** page, select **Microsoft Teams**.
    
         ![Screenshot of the options in the Services & add ins page in the Office 365 admin center.](media/Set_up_Microsoft_Teams_in_your_Office_365_organization_image2.png)

    3. The Microsoft Teams settings screen will open. There are two sections. The top portion is controls for all the users in your organization. The lower portion lets you manage the product per Office license SKU type and for Guests.

- title: Configure Tenant-wide settings
  durationInMinutes: 7
  content: |
    ### General
    The **General** section lets you configure the following settings for your entire institution.

    - Show organizational chart in personal profile.
    - Use Skype for Business for recipients who don’t have Microsoft Teams.
    - Allow T-Bot proactive help messages.

    T-Bot is a great adoption resource for your users. It's a fundamental way we expect users to learn more about the product and highly recommend leaving it enabled. 

    To disable or enable the setting, toggle the switch to **Off** or **On**, and then choose **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the settings in the General section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/Enable_Microsoft_Teams_features_in_your_Office_365_organization_image1.png)

    ### Email integration
    You can enable email integration with channels, as well create a restricted senders list.  To disable or enable the email integration, toggle the switch to **Off** or **On**, and then select **Save**. 

    The allow senders list will help restrict the domains you want to allow to have the ability to email the Teams within your organization. 

    ![Screenshot of the settings in the Email integration section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/QS-edu-email-integration.png)

    ### Apps
    You can enable external apps, new external apps, and sideloading for apps in Microsoft Teams. To disable or enable the setting, toggle the switch to **Off** or **On**, and then choose **Save**.

    Enabling external apps provides a drop-down list for you to select the applications you'd like in your insitution. If you select to **Enable new external apps by default**, as publishers submit more apps, the new apps will automatically show up in your list. 

    The ability to sideload an app will only be available to the Team owners. This will be useful if you have any programing courses or are testing any custom learning management systems that could integrate with Microsoft Teams. 

    ![Screenshot of the settings in the Apps section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/QS-edu-apps.png)

    Once external apps in Teams is enabled, the teachers can customize apps to make them available for their students through tabs. Tabs let you customize a channel to include content and capabilities your team needs every day. They provide quick access to frequently used documents and cloud services. There are several built-in tabs such as Files.

    ![Screenshot of how to add tabs for apps to Microsoft Teams.](media/Add_a_tab_to_Microsoft_Teams_image.png)

    In the Microsoft Teams client, at the top of the channel, users can add tabs for Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, OneNote notebooks, plans from Planner, and more.  Over time, more tabs will be added, both from Microsoft and from partners.

    ### Custom cloud storage
    You can enable various forms of cloud storage within Microsoft Teams. Currently, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and ShareFile are supported. To disable or enable the setting, toggle the switch to **Off** or **On**, and then select **Save**. When these settings are enabled, any member of a team can add a new provider in which documents can be stored to or retreived from.

    ![Screenshot of the settings in the Custom cloud storage section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/Enable_Microsoft_Teams_features_in_your_Office_365_organization_image7.png)

    Microsoft Teams leverages SharePoint as the default file storage provider. For more information, see [How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams](sharepoint-onedrive-interact.md). To learn how your Quota is calculated and how best to manage it, see [Manage site collection storage limits](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-site-collection-storage-limits-77389C2C-8E7E-4B16-AB97-1C7103784B08). If you don’t want to have to manage each site’s collection, you will also learn how to let the service automatically handle that for you.

    Choose the type of user/license you want to configure – **Faculty and Staff** or **Student** or **Guest**.

    ![Screenshot of the settings in the Teams and channels section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/QS-edu-settings-by-user-license-type-showing-dropdown.png)

    Toggle the switch to **On**, and then select **Save**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the settings for Microsoft Teams license picker section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/QS-edu-settings-by-user-license-type-showing-toggle-on.png)

    If you want to disable [Guest Access](guest-access.md) to your tenant, select the **Guest** license and toggle the switch to **Off**. You can use Guest Access to enable Guest Professor Scenario.     
    
    ### Teams and channels
    A *team* is designed to bring together a group of people who work closely to get things done. Teams can be dynamic for project-based work (for example, curriculum development or planning school events), as well as for ongoing work, to reflect the internal structure of your institution (for example, schools, departments, and classes).

    A *channel* is a subcategory of a team. You might create a channel for an activity or for a topic. Conversations, files, and notes are specific to each channel, but all members of the team can see them.

    ![Screenshot of the settings in the Teams and channels section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/Enable_Microsoft_Teams_features_in_your_Office_365_organization_image8.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You need to use the **Groups** control panel, because all Teams are built on top of Groups. 

    You can create and manage team owners and members by using the **Groups** control panel in the Office 365 admin center. By default, Office 365 Groups creation is enabled, but can be disabled through the use of PowerShell. 

    To learn how to use PowerShell to control the permissions, and the types of licenses that are required to take advantage of these features, see [Manage who can create Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-who-can-create-Office-365-Groups-4c46c8cb-17d0-44b5-9776-005fced8e61).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Disabling group creation has implications on other products. These implications are detailed in [Manage who can create Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-who-can-create-Office-365-Groups-4c46c8cb-17d0-44b5-9776-005fced8e61).

    ### Highlights of team management and creation
    ##### Team management
    - For more information about how to create Office 365 Groups in the admin center, see [Create an Office 365 group in the admin center](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Office-365-group-in-the-admin-center-74a1ef8b-3844-4d08-9980-9f8f7a36000f).
    - The Team Naming convention feature provided by Groups is in private preview, and will be available soon in public preview. To learn more about this feature, see [Office 365 Groups naming policy](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-Groups-Naming-Policy-6ceca4d3-cad1-4532-9f0f-d469dfbbb552).
    - Prevent Teams from showing up in the global address list (GAL). To learn more, see "Hide Office 365 Groups from GAL" in [Manage Office 365 Groups with PowerShell](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Manage-Office-365-Groups-with-PowerShell-aeb669aa-1770-4537-9de2-a82ac11b0540).
    - Manage Team\Group Expiration policies. To learn more, see [Office 365 Group Expiration Policy](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-Group-Expiration-Policy-8d253fe5-0e09-4b3c-8b5e-f48def064733).

    ##### Team creation
    - Using School Data Sync. If you are already using School Data Sync, teams will get automatically created based on your roster details. Teachers and students will automatically be assigned. 

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are interested in learning more about School Data Sync, see [Overview of School Data Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/overview-of-school-data-sync). You can sign up for School Data Sync [here](https://sdscrm.microsoftcrmportals.com/signup/).

    - Using PowerShell to create groups. To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams PowerShell reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams). 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For Office 365 for Education, IT Admins can create [four different types of teams](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-a-team-type-to-collaborate-in-Microsoft-Teams-0a971053-d640-4555-9fd7-f785c2b99e67). PowerShell can only create the default type of team. Once a team is created, the type of team can't be changed. 

    ### Calls and meetings
    Some schools might want to restrict the amount of network traffic in their institution. For example, you might want to disable video in low bandwidth institutions. The **Calls and meetings** section lets you choose if users will be allowed to use video or screen sharing during meetings.
    
    ![Screenshot of the settings in the Calls and meetings section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/Enable_Microsoft_Teams_features_in_your_Office_365_organization_image9.png)

    ### Messaging
    As a tenant admin, you can turn on or turn off media content such as GIFs, memes, and stickers in the **Messaging** section of the Microsoft Teams settings screen. You can also disable private chat and other messaging functions on the particular license type you are configuring. If you enable **Allow owners to delete messages** for the faculty and staff license type, teachers can become moderations of class discussions.

    ![Screenshot of the settings in the Messaging section in the Office 365 admin center.](media/QS-edu-messaging.png)

    To disable or enable Giphy to allow users to add gifs to conversations, select **Off** or **On**, and then select **Save**.

    When GIFs are enabled, you can apply a content rating to restrict the type of GIFs that are allowed within the Microsoft Teams in your institution. Content ratings include the following.

    - Strict 
    - Moderate
    - Allow all content

    Additionally, you can enable or allow the following.

    - Memes that users can edit to add to conversations
    - Stickers that users can edit to add to conversations
    - Owners to delete all messages
    - Users to delete their own messages
    - Users to chat privately
