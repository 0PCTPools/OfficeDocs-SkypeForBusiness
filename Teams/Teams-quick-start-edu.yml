    Roll out Microsoft Teams across your institution by following the steps outlined in this tutorial. It includes all the resources you need to be successful. 
    
    Microsoft Teams is available to education customers as part of the Office 365 for Education suite licensing – Education, Education Plus and Education E5, as well as existing Education E3 suites. To learn more about Teams, see [Overview of Microsoft Teams](Teams-overview.md).

    ## Before you begin

    Make sure your network is ready for Microsoft Teams. For information, see [Prepare your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](prepare-network.md).

    Use the Office 365 Admin Center to enable Microsoft Teams for your institution.
    1. [Sign in to Office 365](https://portal.office.com/) with your work or school account.
    2. Select **Admin** to go to the Office 365 admin center.
    3. Navigate to **Settings** > **Services & add-ins**.
    4. On the **Services & add-ins** page, select **Microsoft Teams**.
    5. The Microsoft Teams settings screen will open, select the education license you want to configure – **Faculty and Staff** or **Student**.
    6. After you select the license type you want to enable, set the toggle to **On**, and then select **Save**.

    You can control which users in your institution can use Microsoft Teams. By default, Office 365 Groups creation is enabled in Exchange Online. But, there are a couple of ways an IT Admin can limit the creation of new groups to specific users.

    Every Exchange Online user has an OWA mailbox policy that governs what they can and can't do with their mailbox. By using the **Set-OwaMailboxPolicy** cmdlet, you can configure the *GroupCreationEnabled* parameter to be **$true** for users who are allowed to create groups and **$false** for users who are not authorized to create groups. At this time, the only way to update the mailbox policy is through Windows PowerShell. For more information, see [Use PowerShell to manage Office 365 Groups - Admin help](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-Office-365-Groups-with-PowerShell-aeb669aa-1770-4537-9de2-a82ac11b0540.

    [!NOTE]
     These commands turn off group creation only for OWA and Outlook.

    If you want to turn off group creation in your institution, use Azure Active Directory settings. Or, the [General Availability of Office 365 Planner on June 6, 2016](https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2016/06/06/microsoft-planner-ready-for-showtime/) provides the opportunity to change the control mechanism to a policy stored in Azure Active Directory. 

    The advantage of this approach is that Azure Active Directory provides a central point that all Office 365 applications can check. After a suitable policy is created, control over the creation of new Office 365 Groups is consistent everywhere.

    ### Teams and channels
    A team is designed to bring together a group of people who work closely to get things done. Teams can be dynamic for project-based work (e.g. curriculum development, planning school events), as well as ongoing, to reflect the internal structure of your institution (e.g. schools, departments and classes).

    The setup file for the Microsoft Teams client is an executable that can be downloaded by administrators and end users from the [Microsoft Teams downloads page(https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads). End users on desktops can install the application provided they have the appropriate privileges. IT Admins can also distribute the installer and distribute it through client distribution tools.

    Administrators manage Microsoft Teams licenses by using the Office 365 admin center. You need to be an Office 365 global administrator or user management administrator to manage Microsoft Teams licenses.

    Before you roll out Microsoft Teams to your entire institution, it is recommended that you begin with a few pilot teams of teachers, students, and staff. This helps you refine your launch plan and ensure you are ready for an institution-wide deployment. Successful pilots help generate excitement throughout the institution for the next wave of launch. For more information, see [Pilot Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/pilot-essentials).
