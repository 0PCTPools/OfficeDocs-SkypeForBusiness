Manage large teams in Microsoft Teams - best practices
======================================================

Microsoft Teams is equally effective at facilitating communications between small groups with dozens of members and large groups with thousands of members Review [Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams](limits-specifications-teams.md) for updates on team sizes. 

## Create teams from existing groups

Use contact groups, security groups, or Office groups with up to 3,500 members to jump start your team. See [Create your first teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels.md) for details.

## Create channels to focus discussions

You can narrow the group discussions by creating focused channels. See [Best practices for organizing teams in Microsoft Teams](best-practices-organizing.md).
## Restrict channel creation

If any team member is allowed to create channels, that team can have channel sprawl. Team owners should turn off channel create, update, delete, and restore for members. See [Overview of teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](teams-channels-overview.md)

## Add favorite channels

In order to speed up new user engagement and content discovery, you can select favorite channels that are available to the user by default. See [Create your first teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels.md) for details.

## Regulate team and channel mentions

Team and channel mentions can be used to draw the attention of the whole team to certain channel posts. Once a mention is used in a post, a notification is sent to thousands of team members. If the notifications are too frequent, then team members can become overloaded and might complain to team owners. To prevent team or channel mentions, turn off team and channel mentions for members by unchecking the boxes in the teams Settings pane.

## Disable applications and bots in large teams

To prevent addition of distracting applications or bots, team owners can disable, add, remove, and upload apps and connectors for team members. See [Apps, bots, & connectors in Microsoft Teams](deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)

## Consider setting up moderation in your channels

Team owners can turn on moderation for a channel to control who can start new posts and reply to posts in that channel. When you set up moderation, you can choose one or more team members to be moderators. (Team owners are moderators by default.) For more information, see [Set up and manage channel moderation in Microsoft Teams](manage-channel-moderation-in-teams.md).
