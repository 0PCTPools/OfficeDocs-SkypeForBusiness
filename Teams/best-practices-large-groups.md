Manage large teams in Microsoft Teams - best practices
======================================================

Microsoft Teams is equally effective at facilitating communications between small groups with dozens of members and large groups with thousands of members Review (Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams)[limits-specifications-teams.md] for updates on team sizes. 

## Create teams from existing groups

Use contact groups, security groups, or Office groups with up to 3,500 members to jump start your team. See (Create your first teams and channels in Microsoft Teams)[get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels.md] for details.

## Create channels to focus discussions

You can narrow the group discussions by creating focused channels. See (Best practices for organizing teams in Microsoft Teams)[best-practices-organizing.md].

## Use the General channel

By default, the **General channel** is created for you when you create the team. There are many useful purposes for this channel:

- Use it to share an overview of what the team wants to achieve such as a project charter or who's who in the team.
- Use it for new team member onboarding and other high-level information that a new team member would find useful.
- Use it for announcements, or configure the SharePoint News connector to post your modern status reports to this channel.  
- For new or single purpose teams, it may be the only channel at the beginning as you decide how Teams can best support your goals.

You can't remove, rename, or unfavorite the General channel. Channels appear in alphabetical order (with the General channel at the top). In teams with many channels, use **Hide** or **Show** to display the channels you use the most.

To learn more, peruse the **Work in channels** tab on the [Teams and channels](https://support.office.com/article/teams-and-channels-df38ae23-8f85-46d3-b071-cb11b9de5499#ID0EAABAAA=Work_in_channels) page.

## Consider setting up moderation in your channels

Team owners can turn on moderation for a channel to control who can start new posts and reply to posts in that channel. When you set up moderation, you can choose one or more team members to be moderators. (Team owners are moderators by default.) For more information, see [Set up and manage channel moderation in Microsoft Teams](manage-channel-moderation-in-teams.md).

## Regulate team and channel mentions

Team and channel mentions can be used to draw the attention of the whole team to certain channel posts. Once a mention is used in a post, a notification is sent to thousands of team members. If the notifications are too frequent, then team members can become overloaded and might complain to team owners. To prevent team or channel mentions, turn off team and channel mentions for members by unchecking the boxes in the teams Settings pane.

## Disable applications and bots in large teams

To prevent addition of distracting applications or bots, team owners can disable, add, remove, and upload apps and connectors for team members by unchecking the apps and connectors options in Settings > Member permissions.
