# Virtual user license

They can either buy a Phone System license or use a Phone System - virtual user license for resource accounts. However, for the time being, they must also have a Calling Plan. They need three licenses to be assigned to a resource account: Phone System (either), Calling Plan, Communication Credits.



## Free Virtual Licenses

The number of free licenses your organization has to assign to call queues or auto attendants depends on the overall size. The table below summarizes how free licenses scale.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|:---------|:---------|
|Row1     |         |
|Row2     |         |
|Row3     |         |
|Row4     |         |
|Row5     |         |
|Row6     |         |

If your organization uses up its free licenses in creating auto attendant or call queue nodes, you'll have to use the paid licenses.
