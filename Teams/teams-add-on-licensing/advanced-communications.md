Advanced Communications add-on for Microsoft Teams
=============================================

Starting August 1, 2020, Advanced Communications is available as a Microsoft Teams add-on license to any paid Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription. If your organization is looking to further enhance your communication experience, get Advanced Communications for enhanced calling and meeting capabilities that include large meetings, meeting customization, communications integrations and workflows, and advanced tools to manage your organization's communications policies.

## What is Advanced Communications?

Advanced Communications provides calling and meeting capabilities that address a spectrum of communications needs, including the following:

- **Reach larger audiences**: Help your users stay connected with live events for up to 20,000 participants and interactive meetings for 1,000 participants with the capability to enable up to 20,000 participants in a view-only meeting experience.
- **Tailor and customize meetings**: Drive standardization across meetings for your internal and custom-facing scenarios, with features such as custom branded meeting lobby. Implement with flexibility across your organization's departments. 
- **Connect meetings and calling to workflows**: Integrate workflows to your communication system. For example, have your compliance recording policy automated, and become part of the communication workflow, without the need for manual intervention.  
- **Manage your organization communications**: Monitor, track, and analyze data on users and devices to ensure a smooth experience.

> Advanced Communications isn't yet available for Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, or Department of Defense (DoD) environments. We're planning on make it available later.

### What's the differeence between overflow meetings and live events?

With Advanced Communications overflow meetings, any meeting with more than 300 attendees will provide a way for up to 20,000 total participants to join the meeting in a view-only experience.

Additionally, weâ€™re increasing the length of the live events from 4 hours to 16 hours and enabling up to 50 concurrent live events per tenant for customers who have Advanced Communications.
