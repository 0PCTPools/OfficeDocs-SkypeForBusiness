Advanced Communications Teams add-on license
=============================================

Starting August 1, 2020, Advanced Communications is available as a Microsoft Teams add-on license to any paid Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription. 

## What is Advanced Communications?

Advanced Communications offers enhanced calling and meeting capabilities and addresses a spectrum of communications needs, including the following:

- **Reach larger audiences**: Help your users stay connected with live events for up to 20,000 participants and interactive meetings for 1,000 participants with the capability to enable up to 20,000 participants in a view-only meeting experience.
- **Tailor and customize meetings**: Drive standardization across meetings  for your internal and custom-facing scenarios, with features such as custom branded meeting lobby. 
- **Connect meetings and calling to workflows**: Integrate workflows to your communication system. For example, have your compliance recording policy automated, and become part of the communication workflow, without the need for manual intervention.  
- **Manage your organization communications**: Monitor, track, and analyze data on users and devices to ensure a smooth experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Advanced Communications is not yet available for Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, or Department of Defense (DoD) environments. We're planning on make it available later.

### What's the differeence between overflow meetings and live events?

With Advanced Communications overflow meetings, any meeting with more than 300 attendees will provide a way for up to 20,000 total participants to join the meeting in a view-only experience. Live events enable additional capabilities: with live events, 20,000 attendees can watch the broadcast, plus interact with Q&A in Teams, conversation in Yammer, or view-only in Stream. Additionally, weâ€™re increasing the length of the live events from 4 hours to 16 hours and enabling up to 50 concurrent live events per tenant for customers who have Advanced Communications.
