Advanced Communications add-on for Microsoft Teams
=============================================

Starting August 1, 2020, Advanced Communications is available as a Microsoft Teams add-on SKU to any paid Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription. 

If your organization is looking to further enhance your communication experience, get Advanced Communications for advanced calling and meeting capabilities that include large meetings, meeting customization, communications integrations and workflows, and tools to manage your organization's communications policies.

## What is Advanced Communications?

Advanced Communications provides calling and meeting capabilities that address a spectrum of communications needs, including the following:

- **Reach larger audiences**: Help your users stay connected with live events for up to 20,000 participants and interactive meetings for 1,000 participants with the capability to enable up to 20,000 participants in a view-only meeting experience.
- **Tailor and customize meetings**: Drive standardization across meetings for your internal and custom-facing scenarios, with features such as custom branded meeting lobby. Implement with flexibility across your organization's departments. 
- **Connect meetings and calling to workflows**: Integrate workflows to your communication system. For example, have your compliance recording policy automated, and become part of the communication workflow, without the need for manual intervention.  
- **Manage your organization communications**: Monitor, track, and analyze data on users and devices to ensure a smooth experience.

Advanced Communications is available in all Microsoft 365 markets as an add-on to any paid Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan. Features that are included in Advanced Communications won't be added to other Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plans. To get the features, you must purchase the add-on.

Advanced Communications isn't yet available for Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, or Department of Defense (DoD) environments. We're planning on make it available later.


## Feature availability

At release on August 1, 2020, the following features are available:

- Live events support for up to 20,000 participants, 50 concurrent, event duration of 16 hours per broadcast
- Compliance recording integration (ISV)
- Contact Center solution integration (ISV)

The following features will be available later in 2020:

We'll be adding more customizations, tools, and communications enhancements. 

Note that communications compliance and communications data loss prevention (DLP) isn't included in Advanced Communications.

## Pricing

Advanced Communications is $12 per user/month. Keep in mind that only meeting organizers need a license. Meeting attendees don't need a license. 

### What's the difference between overflow meetings and live events?

With Advanced Communications overflow meetings, any meeting with more than 300 attendees will provide a way for up to 20,000 total participants to join the meeting in a view-only experience. Live events enable additional capabilities. With live events, 20,000 attendees can watch the broadcast, plus interact with Q&A in Teams, conversations in Yammer, or view-only in Microsoft Stream. Additionally, with Advanced Communications, the length of the live events is increased from 4 hours to 16 hours, you can host up to 50 simultaneous live events per tenant.
