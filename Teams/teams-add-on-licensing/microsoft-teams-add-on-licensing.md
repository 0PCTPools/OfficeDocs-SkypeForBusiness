# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

## What are add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams features. They give you the flexibility to add features only for users in your organization who need them. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Here's a list of features that you can add with Teams add-on licenses. The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan you have.

For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762).  <br/> |&#x2713;<sup>1</sup>|&#x2713;|
|**Toll free numbers** |If you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues, you must [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). <br/> |&#x2713;|&#x2713;|
|**Phone System** <br/> |[Phone System](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) is a hosted telephone service that gives you call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities, with options for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

<sup>1</sup> If you're a small or medium-sized business who has a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan, you can still buy add-on licenses for these cloud voice features, however, we recommend that you consider a [Microsoft 365 business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-products?&activetab=tab:primaryr2) plan and [Business Voice](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/business-voice).

## What voice features are available with my plan?

See what add-on licenses you need to get voice features in Teams, depending on the plan you have.

Depending on the voice features that you want, we recommend comparing whether it's more cost effective for you to switch to a plan that includes those features. For example, for most large organizations, buying a bundle of software in a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with a higher combined cost.

#### [**Small business**](#tab/small-business/)

For small and medium sized businesses (less than 300 people), there are three ways to get cloud voice features:
- Buy a small business license along with Microsoft 365 Business Voice.
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 license with Microsoft 365 Business Voice.
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 license but add on each cloud voice feature separately.
- Buy an Enterprise E5 license that comes with cloud voice features.

If your an organization with less than 300 people, you can choose  [Microsoft 365 Business](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-products?&activetab=tab:primaryr2) plans to chose from.
- Microsoft Business Voice with a Calling Plan - OR -
- Microsoft Business Voice without a Calling Plan (Direct Routing).

If you want all phone number management and billing for cloud voice features to be delivered from Microsoft, then you want to use **Business Voice with a Calling Plan**. If you already get your telephone service from another third party telephone provider, you would want to choose **Business Voice without a Calling Plan**. For this, you will need to set up and deploy Direct Routing to connect your on-premises Session Border Controllers (SBCs) to Microsoft 365.

[!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprises can't be purchased and used with small business plans but Microsoft 365 Apps for businesses can be.

> [!NOTE]
> Direct Routing can also be used with Enterprise-based licensing.

If you're a small or medium-sized business (less than 300 users) who already has a Microsoft 365 Enterprise (or EDU, GOV or Nonprofit) plan, you can still buy add-on licenses for individual voice features. However, you have the option to move from that license and buy and assign a [Microsoft 365 Business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-products?&activetab=tab:primaryr2) plan and [Microsoft 365 Business Voice](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/business-voice). In some cases, depending on the features that you want, it might be more cost effective to get a Microsoft 365 Business plan with Microsoft 365 Business Voice.

#### [**Enterprise**](#tab/enterprise/)

For large sized businesses and enterprises (more than 300 people), there are two ways to get cloud voice features:
- Enterprise E1 or E3 (and then add cloud voice features individually - OR -
- Enterprise E5 (that includes cloud voice features).

These plans both include most Microsoft Teams features. However, if you want voice features like audio conferencing and voice calling, you will need to add them on separately. Or, you can purchase an Enterprise E5 license that includes a long list of features including Cloud Voice. To see more, [Enterprise E5 features](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise-e5-business-software?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab).

#### [**Nonprofit**](#tab/nonprofit/)
For nonprofit organizations, there are three ways to get cloud voice features but the option you choose will depend on the features you want and the price for buying your licenses.
- Buy a small business plan specifically for nonprofit organizations and add the cloud voice features.
- Buy a Nonprofit E1 or E3 plan (and then add cloud voice features individually)
- Buy a Nonprofit E5 (that includes cloud voice features).

These plans both include most Microsoft Teams features. However, if you want voice features like audio conferencing and voice calling, you will need to add them on separately. Or, you can purchase an Enterprise E5 license that includes a long list of features including Cloud Voice.

#### [**Trial offers**](#tab/trial/)

In response to an increased need for people to work remotely (or work from home), Microsoft has several free Teams trial offers for government, educational, and non-profit organizations:

- [Office 365 E1 Trial](../e1-trial-license.md), which includes Teams, is a free 6-month E1 license for any customer that's managed by a Microsoft account rep. It's for organizations, including nonprofits, who haven't activated any other Office 365 E1 trials in the past.

- For GCC, check out the [free Office 365 G1 Trial](../g1-trial-license.md).

- EDU customers should use the [free Office 365 A1 license](../teams-edu-licensing.md).
