Conduct an eDiscovery investigation of content in Microsoft Teams
============================

Large Enterprises are often exposed to high penalty legal proceedings which demand submission of all Electronically Stored Information (ESI).

All Teams 1:1 or group chats are journaled through to the respective users’ mailboxes and all channel messages are journaled through to the group mailbox representing the Team. Files uploaded are covered under the eDiscovery functionality for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business.

1.  To conduct an eDiscovery investigation with Microsoft Teams content, review [this](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-eDiscovery-cases-in-the-Office-365-Security-Compliance-Center-edea80d6-20a7-40fb-b8c4-5e8c8395f6da?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#step1) link.

2.  Microsoft Teams data will appear as **IM or Conversations** in the Excel output, or you can mount the **.PST** in Outlook.

    a.  When mounting the .PST for the Team, note that all conversations are kept in the Team Chat folder under Conversation History. The title of the message aligns to Team and Channel. From reviewing the image below, you can see this message from Bob who messaged the Project 7 channel of the Manufacturing Specs team.
