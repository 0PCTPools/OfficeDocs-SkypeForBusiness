# Overview of optional connected experiences in Microsoft Teams

If you have a work or school account, your organization's admin may have provided you with the ability to use one or more cloud-backed services (also referred to as **optional connected experiences**) while using Microsoft Teams, like GIPHY, URL Preview service, Paste Image Download, and/or UserVoice . These cloud-backed services are optional. Whether you use them is up to you. They're provided to you under the terms of the Microsoft Services Agreement and privacy statement. In some cases, other terms may also apply. This article lists our Teams cloud-backed services.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, see the following articles to learn how to give or restrict your users' ability to use optional connected experiences: ???

## GIPHY

GIPHY is a cloud-backed service that lets you use GIFs in your Teams chats. If you’re in **Teams** > **GIF** > **Search**, the search terms are sent to GIPHY. These experiences, if allowed by your admin and after you choose to use them, are subject to the [GIPHY Privacy Policy](https://support.giphy.com/hc/articles/360032872931-GIPHY-Privacy-Policy) and [Terms of Service](https://support.giphy.com/hc/articles/360020027752-GIPHY-User-Terms-of-Service). ???

## URL Preview service  

The URL Preview service automatically generates a preview snippet and attaches under the snippet the URL when a user sends a URL string.

## Paste image download

Paste Image Download allows you to copy an image from a website and paste it into a Teams chat. If the admin configuration settings don’t allow for content from third-party sources the image will be striped, and the user will see an error message alerting user of the policy settings. If the Paste Image Download experience, is allowed by your admin and you choose to use it, you are subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service dependent upon where the image and website used to take the image from because this can be an almost infinite number of websites there is no way for Microsoft to represent which Privacy Policy or Terms of Service is applicable.

## Suggest a Feature

Suggest a Feature is an experience that allows you to submit your ideas regarding your use of Teams. If you’re in **Teams** > **Help** > **Suggest a Feature**, will enable provided directly to a third-party service called UserVoice. If allowed by your admin to submit ideas using Suggest a Feature, the terms of service and privacy policy of UserVoice will apply.
