Journey from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams
==================================================

As part of the Microsoft intelligent communications vision to deliver smarter calling and meeting experiences, we’re building Skype for Business capabilities into Teams. This will happen over time, and ultimately Teams will become the single client experience. 
As a valued Skype for Business customer, Microsoft is here to support you every step of the way on your journey to Teams. We understand that change takes time, so we invite you to begin exploring Teams today to understand the value it can offer to your organization, while you continue to run Skype for Business. 

Visit the [Teams product roadmap](https://aka.ms/TeamsRoadmap) to stay on top of what’s coming next in Teams and decide the best time for your organization to move to Teams.

For best results, we recommend that you follow this guidance in order:


[1 - Optimize your current Skype for Business environment for Teams](prepare-teams.md)

[2 - Pilot Teams alongside Skype for Business](pilot-essentials.md)

[3 - Enable Teams side-by-side with Skype for Business](guidance-SkypeforBusiness.md)

[4 - Drive value through user adoption](continue-journey.md)
