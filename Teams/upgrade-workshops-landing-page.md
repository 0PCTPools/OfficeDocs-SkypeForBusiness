# Teams upgrade planning workshops

Congratulations on your pending upgrade from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams. More than a backend technical migration, upgrading to Teams offers your users the ability to transform they work, streamlining productivity, improving user satisfaction, and accelerating business outcomes. ​

As a valued Skype for Business customer, we are committed to your success and want to ensure you have everything you need as you navigate your journey to Teams. We're excited to invite you to a series of live, interactive upgrade workshops, providing guidance, best practices and resources you can leverage to facilitate your upgrade to Teams.​

We strongly encourage all members of your project team to start with Plan Your Upgrade, a 30-min foundational session that establishes the framework for your upgrade journey.​
