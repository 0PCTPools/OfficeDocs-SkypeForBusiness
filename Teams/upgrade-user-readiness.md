# Prepare my user readiness plan - ROUGH


An optimal user readiness plan incorporates how you will communicate, train and
support your end users as you pilot, onboard and upgrade to Teams. As you
discovered in the **Prepare My Organization** activity, readiness is not
one-size-fits-all. To ensure optimal reception to the new technology, utilize a
combination of broad-reach messaging (incorporating the *Vision/Value messaging*
and *Universal Use Cases*) and tailored messaging, training and support to your
*defined persona/cohorts* as well as your laggards, as appropriate. This
personalized plan will enable users to more quickly relate to Teams while
demonstrating that you understand their needs, helping facilitate their
adoption.

*Decision Points:*

-   *How can you create a readiness plan to facilitate and accelerate user
    adoption of the new solution?*

-   *Do you have the right awareness, training, and support resources that align
    with your users’ ability to deal with change and the user personas you’ve
    defined?*

*Next Steps*

-   *Use the list below to generate ideas for your readiness plan. Select the
    most relevant activities—or add your own—to design a readiness plan
    optimized for your organization. Remember to use a combination of
    broad-reach (for your whole organization) and targeted campaigns (for
    laggards or specific personas) for maximum results.*
