# Prepare my user readiness plan - ROUGH


An optimal user readiness plan incorporates how you will communicate, train and support your end users as you pilot, onboard and upgrade to Teams. As you discovered in the **Prepare My Organization** activity, readiness is not one-size-fits-all. To ensure optimal reception to the new technology, utilize a combination of broad-reach messaging (incorporating the *Vision/Value messaging* and *Universal Use Cases*) and tailored messaging, training and support to your *defined persona/cohorts* as well as your laggards, as appropriate. This personalized plan will enable users to more quickly relate to Teams while demonstrating that you understand their needs, helping facilitate their adoption.
