# Deploy apps, bots, & connectors in Microsoft Teams


Apps let you find content from your favorite services and share it right in Teams. They help you do things such as pin services at the top of a channel, chat with bots, or share and assign tasks. To learn more, read [Overview of apps in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/overview-of-apps-in-teams-747492ee-7cdd-4115-a993-8c7e7f98a3d0).

We recommend that you roll out apps, bots, & connectors throughout your Teams deployment. 

<!-- Sharon, I copied this section from the deploy-chat landing page. Need to figure out what else goes here. (We may want to leave this section in the deploy-chat page, then link over to HERE for additional guidance.) Need to figure out how much is "just enable it" vs. what is "ongoing management & configuration." Based on the articles in this Apps TOC node, you may be able to come up with a first stab at the list. -->
### Teams Default Apps 

Teams provides a number of Microsoft provided and 3rd party apps via the Teams
Store to engage your users and provide additional productivity capabilities and
integration of commonly used business services into Teams. The default
configuration is that the these apps are enabled for users to explore and use,
for example users can make use of the Planner app to build and manage team tasks
in a very effective manner. The out of the box configuration enables the teams
default apps as well as external apps that have been submitted via the [Teams
Store approval
process.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/publishing/apps-publish#microsoft-teams-app-approval-process)

For more information see the [Admin settings for apps in Microsoft
Teams.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/admin-settings)
