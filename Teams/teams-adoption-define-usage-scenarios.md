# Define usage scenarios and select early adopters for Microsoft Teams

Make sure that you understand the business projects (scenarios) that will be in scope for this phase of your implementation. Take a look at this list of example scenarios that are great candidates for an early adopter program. You can get started with easy wins such as:

- Personal productivity
- Modern project management
- Modern meetings

Additional scenarios for consider are:

- Employee engagement and communication
- Bring campaigns to market faster
- Increase sales productivity and grow revenue
- Streamline business reviews

Think of this scenario modernization motion as a cumulative process – get things going with more basic scenarios to create enthusiasm, familiarity, and credibility with this new way of working. Then move on to more ambitious areas of impact. As more impact with Microsoft Teams is demonstrated to your business colleagues, more of them will get engaged and momentum will build. For many of our customers, once they get this process going they find that business stakeholders approach them after learning how their colleagues got value from Microsoft Teams.

## Interview business stakeholders

To confirm the selection of these early projects we recommend meeting directly with the stakeholders you identified earlier in this process. Your goal at this point is to listen and learn additional information about their business. Consider the following questions to drive the conversation:

- What are some of the organization’s challenges or pain points related to communication and collaboration?
- What are the areas in which your organization would like to improve?
- What are the organization’s strategic initiatives or current transformation projects that Teams can support?
- What methods of communication and collaboration are typically better received by your organization than others?
- What is the process for drafting, distributing, and sharing information?

## Prioritize business scenarios

To be sure that you have the right information about the business scenario, consider using the following format to document the scenario from the perspective of the employee completing the work and the business owner of the process. Both perspectives are required to craft a successful path forward.

After speaking to one or more business stakeholders you can prioritize your scenarios based on impact vs. difficulty. (Your scenarios may be in addition to the scenarios we suggest above.) Appropriate candidates for your experimentation phase should have higher impact and low to medium difficulty. This will ensure your project isn't affected by scope creep or technical difficulties before you are able to show the value of your work. An example chart is shown below.

> We are always eager to learn about how our customers use Teams in new an innovative ways. Share your #TeamsStories with us in our [Driving Adoption discussion forum]. Include the hashtag **#TeamsStories** in your post. We are always interested in how you use Teams in your organization.

## Onboard early adopters

Return to the list of employees who expressed interest in your early adopter program. Decide which of these individuals should participate in your initial experiments with Teams. It may be all or a portion of the people who are interested. Even if you do not select them for these initial projects, continue communicating with them so they remain interested and will be willing to participate in the future. They will be a part of the onboarding process for the projects you selected based on your discussions with business stakeholders, your technical team, and your prioritization exercise shown above. 

Complete the following steps with these early adopters:

1. Send an invitation email to them to invite them into the community,
2. Host a kick-off call to share with them the goals and outcomes of the early adopter program,
3. Ensure access to the feedback channel of your teamwork champions team and any other internal social networking tools you may use. 
4. Consider creating periodic surveys for them to complete that will gather targeted information.

## Gather feedback

Use the components of Office 365 to gather feedback for your project.
  
**Decision**: If your organization already has an investment in a Yammer network, you can use it as a feedback forum for your early adopter program. If not, and your early adopter program has less than 2500 members, create a team in Teams to gather feedback and provide training.
  
> [!Note]
> Some organizations will combine the channels for early adopter feedback into the teamwork champions program team. This is a good approach because many early adopters may become champions in the future, and it will build a stronger community. 

## Onboard support

To ensure that the early adopter and champions teams will have the appropriate support as they start using Teams, meet with your support staff and review the capabilities of Teams. Key members of the support organization may want to join your early adopter program. Encourage their use of Teams in their own scenarios. Take them through the basic onboarding of the product by using our online training resources.
