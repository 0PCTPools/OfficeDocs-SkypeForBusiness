# Define usage scenarios and select early adopters

Make sure that you understand the business projects (scenarios) that will be in scope for this phase of your implementation. Take a look at this list of example scenarios that are great candidates for an early adopter program:

- Improve employee engagement and communication
- Bring campaigns to market faster
- Increase sales productivity and revenue
- Streamline business reviews
- Manage employee time off requests

Begin with more basic scenarios to create credibility and then move on to more ambitious areas of impact. As more and more impact with Microsoft Teams is demonstrated to your business colleagues, more of them will get engaged and the momentum will build. Once you deliver a few scenarios, you may find that business stakeholders approach you after learning how their colleagues realized business value from Microsoft Teams.


## Interview business stakeholders

To confirm the selection of these early projects we recommend meeting directly with the stakeholders you identified earlier in this process. Your goal at this point is to listen and learn additional information about their business. Consider the following questions to drive the conversation:

- What are some of the organization’s challenges or pain points related to communication and collaboration?
- What are the areas in which your organization would like to improve?
- What are the organization’s strategic initiatives or current transformation projects that Microsoft Teams can support?
- What methods of communication and collaboration are typically better received by your organization than others?
- What is the process for drafting, distributing, and sharing information?

## Mapping and prioritizing business scenarios

To be sure that you have the right information about the business scenario, consider using the following format to document the scenario from the perspective of the employee completing the work and the business owner of the process. Both perspectives are required to craft a successful path forward.

After speaking to one or more business stakeholders you can prioritize your scenarios based on impact vs. difficulty. Appropriate candidates for your experimentation phase should have higher impact and low to medium difficulty. This will ensure your project isn't affected by scope creep or technical difficulties before you are able to show the value of your work. An example chart is shown below.

> [!Note]
> We are always looking to learn about how our customers use Microsoft Teams in new an innovative ways. Share your Teams stories with us in our Driving Adoption discussion forum. Include the hashtag **#TeamsStories** in your post. We are always interested in how you use Microsoft Teams in your organization.

## Select Early Adopters

Return to the list of employees who expressed interest in your early adopter program. Decide who of these individuals should participate in your initial experiments with Teams. It may be all or a part of the people who are interested. Even if you do not select them for these initial projects, continue communicating with them so they remain interested and will be willing to participate in the future. They will be a part of the onboarding process for the projects you selected based on your discussions with business stakeholders, your technical team, and your prioritization exercise shown above. 

## Gathering Feedback

Use the components of Office 365 to gather feedback for your project.
  
**Decision**: If your organization already has an investment in a Yammer network, you can use it as a feedback forum for your early adopter program. If not, and your early adopter program has less than 2500 members, create a team in Microsoft Teams to gather feedback and provide training.
  
> [!Note]
> Some organizations will combine the channels for early adopter feedback into the Teamwork Champions program team. This is a good approach because many early adopters may become champions in the future, and it will build a stronger community. 

## Bring your support staff on board

To ensure that the early adopter and champions teams will have the appropriate support as they start using Microsoft Teams, meet with your support staff and review the capabilities of Microsoft Teams. Key members of the support organization may want to join your early adopter program. Encourage their use of Teams in their own scenarios. Take them through the basic onboarding of the product by using our online training resources.
