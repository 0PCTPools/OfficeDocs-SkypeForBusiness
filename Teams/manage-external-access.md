Manage external access (federation) in Microsoft Teams
======================================================

With Microsoft Teams external access, users from other domains can participate in your chats and calls. You can also allow external users who are still using Skype for Business to participate. 

External access (federation) and guest access are different:

- Guest access gives access permission to an individual. External access gives access permission to an entire domain.

- Guest access, once granted by a team owner, allows a guest to [access resources](guest-experience.md), such as channel discussions and files, for a specific team, and chat with other users in the team they have been invited to. With external access (federated chat), the external chat participants have no access to the inviting organizationâ€™s teams or team resources. They can only participate in one-on-one federated chat. Tenant admins can choose between the two communication options depending on which level of collaboration is desirable with the external party. Admins can choose either approaches or both, depending on their organizational needs, but we recommend enabling guest access for a fuller, collaborative Teams experience. 

See the following table for a comparison of external and guest access features.

| Feature | External access users | Guest access users |
