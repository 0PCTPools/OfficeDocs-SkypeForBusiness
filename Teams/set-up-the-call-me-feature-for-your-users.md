# Set up the Call me feature for your users

In Microsoft Teams, the **Call me** feature gives users a way to join the audio portion of a meeting by phone. This is handy in scenarios when using a computer for audio might not be possible. Users get the audio portion of the meeting through their cell phone or land line and the content portion of the meeting&mdash;such when another meeting participant shares their screen or plays a video&mdash;through their computer.

## The user experience

Click **Join** to join a meeting, and then click **Phone audio** on the  **Choose your audio and video settings** screen. From here, users can have the meeting call and join them or dial in manually to the meeting.

**Let the Teams meeting call**

On the **Use phone for audio** screen, the user enters their phone number, and then clicks **Call me**. The meeting calls the user and joins them to the meeting.

**Dial in manually**

Another way to join is to dial in directly to the meeting. On the **Use phone for audio** screen, click **Dial in manually** to get a list of phone numbers to use to dial in to the meeting.

## Set up the Call me feature

To enable the Call me feature for users in your organization, the following must be configured:

- Audio Conferencing is enabled for users in your organization who schedule meetings (meeting organizers). To learn more, see [Set up Audio Conferencing for Teams](set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md) and [Manage the Audio Conferencing settings for a user in Teams](manage-the-audio-conferencing-settings-for-a-user-in-teams.md).

- Users can dial out from meetings. To learn more, see [Manage the Audio Conferencing settings for a user in Teams](manage-the-audio-conferencing-settings-for-a-user-in-teams.md).

If a user doesn't have dial out from meetings enabled, the **Call me** option isn't available and the user won't receive a call to join them to the meeting. Instead, the user sees a list of phone numbers on the **Use phone for audio** screen that they can use to dial in manually to the meeting on their phone.
