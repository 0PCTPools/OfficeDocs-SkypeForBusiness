This article is part of the Technical Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the User Readiness stage. Before proceeding, confirm that you’ve completed these activities from previous stages:

-   [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
-   [Defined your project scope](upgrade-define-project-scope.md)
-   [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](upgrade-understand-coexistence-and-interoperability.md)

# Prepare your service for upgrading to Teams

This article gives an overview of the requirements for preparing your organization for collaboration and cloud voice services with Teams. By preparing properly, you can be sure you’re ready to provide these capabilities to your organization.

## Onboarding checklists for Microsoft Teams rollout

The following checklists walk you through the steps for deploying Microsoft Teams in your organization:

-  [Prepare Office 365 for Teams](onboarding-checklist-enable-office-365.md)

-  [Configure Teams core capabilities](onboarding-checklist-configure-microsoft-teams-core-capabilities.md)

-  [Configure networking](onboarding-checklist-configure-networking.md)

-  [Configure cloud voice workloads in Teams](onboarding-checklist-configure-cloud-voice-workloads-in-Microsoft-Teams.md)

-  [Configure Direct Routing in Teams](onboarding-checklist-configure-direct-routing-in-microsoft-teams.md)

The tasks and activities in these checklists are the core “to-do” items that apply to every deployment of collaboration and voice capabilities with Teams. You can customize the checklists to include the activities and tasks that are specific to your own Teams journey. 

Use the provided checklists to track the status of each individual activity and task, and to be sure you haven’t skipped any critical steps. Each activity includes a detailed description of required actions and references to additional information that you can use to complete that activity.

[//]: # (@Debbie, should I delete this mention of a "greenfield" deployment?)

Although we recommend that you follow the checklists in order, the exact sequence will depend on the scope of your deployment and the configuration and complexity of your environment. They’re organized to support either a “greenfield” Teams deployment (one with no previous Skype for Business Online presence) or upgrading from Skype for Business Online to Teams. If you’re upgrading from Skype for Business Online, you might have already completed some of these activities and can ignore them now.

When you’re onboarding users on a per-site basis, we highly recommended that you use the [Site Enablement Playbook for Voice (Playbook)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SkypeForBusiness/blob/live/Teams/downloads/site-enablement-playbook-for-voice-(playbook).xlsx?raw=true) as a supplementary guide to these checklists.

>[!NOTE]
>Most of the configuration settings are common between Teams and Skype for Business Online. You use Office 365 Skype for Business Administration Center to configure those settings.

After you complete this checklist, you’ll have successfully deployed Teams in your organization.
