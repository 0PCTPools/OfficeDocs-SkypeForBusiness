# Team-scoped roles  (may 19)


When enabled by the Admin, Tags and fields can be added to people within a team to make referencing groups of people simple and manageable.

**Usage Example** If a Doctor wants to send a message to notify a group of nurses within a ward that a patient is missing from their bed, they can simply send it to all users in the Team having the role-based tag "Nurse."

Team Owner assigns the tags. Admin has no further actions other than enabling the feature.
