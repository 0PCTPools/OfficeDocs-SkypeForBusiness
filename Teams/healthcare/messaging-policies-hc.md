# Get started with Secure Messaging policies for Healthcare organizations

Messaging policies are used to control which chat and channel messaging features are available to users in Microsoft Teams, and are part of the overall deployment of Secure Messaging for Healthcare organizations like Hospitals, clinics, or doctor's offices. 

You can use the default policy that is created or create one or more custom messaging policies for people in your organization. After you create a policy, you will assign it a user or groups of users in your organization. For example, you may choose to only allow certain job roles to use these features (perhaps doctors and nurses only) and other workers (like the janitorial or kitchen staff) to get a more limited set of features. Decide for yourself what needs your organization has.

Policies can be easily managed in the [Microsoft Teams admin center](http://admin.teams.microsoft.com) by logging in with administrator credentials and choosing **Messaging Policies** in the left navigation pane.

To edit the existing default Messaging policy for your organization, click the **Global (Org-wide default)** row, and then make your changes. To create a new custom messaging policy, click **New policy** and select your settings. Choose **Save** when you are done.

The following settings are of special value to Healthcare applications, and should be considered when designing a custom policy used in the Healthcare field:

- **Read receipts** Use this setting to specify whether read receipts are user controlled, enabled for everyone, or disabled.

- **Priority Notifications** Use this setting to allow users to set a priority for chat messages sent to other users. This can help the message recipient quickly see what needs immediate attention and what is "nice-to-know."

When the Priority Notifications and Read Receipts settings are both enabled, if a user sends a message and requests it, they will be notified when the recipient reads the message.
