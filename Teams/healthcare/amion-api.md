# AMION scheduling app for Teams 

The AMION app displays on-call data for hospitals and gives users an option to import that data into Shifts. The import happens seamlessly using the Graph APIs without further user input. 

Admins in a healthcare environment can choose to restrict access to third party apps, but if you wish to use the patients app and shifts you will probably want to enable this app as well.
