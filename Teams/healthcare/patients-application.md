This content was forwarded to Jessica Reading on 2/20/2019. Her team will document the end-user side of the Patients' App.

It's our understanding that this app doesn't require specific Teams Admin documentation, other than documenting whatever Template is needed to integrate the document, which would trigger an update to [Get started with Teams templates for Healthcare organizations](../../healthcare/healthcare-templates.md). If this turns out not to be the case, this stub is left as a "notebook" page for the feature.
