# Get started with Teams for Healthcare organizations

Microsoft Teams offers features useful for hospitals and other Healthcare organizations.

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Integrate-electronic-health-records-into-Microsoft-Teams-care/ba-p/334042Â  
has a lot of information that should be shoveled into this article.

## Care Coordination

New templates were developed to apply to a Hospital setting, and more are expected soon. This makes it easier to create Teams that Healthcare workers use to coordinate care for patients in various departments or wards. See [Get started with Teams templates for Healthcare organizations](healthcare-templates.md).

## Secure Messaging

Secure messaging includes several new features:

- A message sender can set a special priority for their message, so the recipient is repeatedly notified until they read the message.
- A message sender can request a read receipt, so they are notified when a message they sent was read by the message recipient.

Together, these features allow quicker attention to urgent messages and confidence that the message was received and read.

See [Get started with Secure Messaging policies for Healthcare organizations](messaging-policies-hc.md) for further details.

## EHR integration

Electronic health information records Integration using [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is enabled using Teams Templates. Feature coming soon.

## Firstline Worker integration

Microsoft Teams integrates with Firstline Worker, allowing shift staffing and more features, See the following articles:
