# Auditing logs for Patients app 

Keeping an Audit log for Patients app activity allows after-incident response teams to review changes to patients records and determine if changes or improvements in policy or procedure are needed.

## Usage example 
  
Why would an admin need to enable this feature or perform this task in real life? What questions does this answer, or what problem does it solve? Answer the question in the back of the Admin's mind: "Why is this worth my time?"

Could sometimes be a before/after illustration that shows something going wrong because the feature isn't available or being used, and then the same situation with a better outcome because the feature helped the users.

## Configure Patients app

For information on how to set up Patients app, see [Integrating Electronic Healthcare Records into Microsoft Teams](../expand-teams-across-your-org/healthcare/patients-app.md).

You enable activity audits for Patients App the same way you would any other activity in Office 365 as described in [Turn Office 365 audit log search on or off](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off#turn-on-audit-log-search).

### (Optional) Use case
