# Understand the Patients App and EHR integration interface


## Patients App overview

Microsoft Teams is developing a Patients app specific to healthcare organizations to help them meet their ultimate goal of providing the best patient care. The Microsoft Teams Patient App is a first party tab app that integrates with electronic health record (EHR) systems using a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ([FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)) interface to bring valuable medical information into Microsoft Teams. This enables clinical workers to collaborate and communicate across the care continuum. The care coordination solution can interface with leading Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) that can connect the Patients App to your EHR systems using existing health data standards like HL7v2 and FHIR. Microsoft partners with the following indjstry leaders to establish electronic health record integration with Teams:

- Datica (through their [CMI](https://datica.com/compliant-managed-integration/) offering)
- Infor Cloverleaf (through the [Infor FHIR Bridge](https://pages.infor.com/hcl-infor-fhir-bridge-brochure.html))
- Redox (through the [R^FHIR server](https://www.redoxengine.com/fhir/))
- Dapasoft (through [Corolar on FHIR](https://www.dapasoft.com/corolar-fhir-server-for-microsoft-teams/))

An EHR integration or interop partner trying to implement Microsoft Teams for a healthcare provider organization needs to provide the Patients App a secure and authenticated connection with the healthcare provider organization's EHR systems to provide patient record data to the Microsoft Teams Patients App while transforming the aggregated data from various other formats like HL7v2, etc. into the FHIR DSTU2 or STU3 standard.

Microsoft Teams is bringing new healthcare-specific features to market in the care team collaboration and coordination space. Healthcare teams need a secure hub for coordinating care across multiple patients. The Patients app integrates with electronic health records (EHR) systems and enables care providers to communicate about patient care in real-time within Teams’ secure platform. The Patients app addresses the following challenges that are commonly observe in today's healthcare industry in the care coordination area:

- Low efficiency in hand-offs and critical communication through the patient experience
- Siloed information that creates administrative burdens
- Dissatisfaction among clinicians with complex and fragmented collaboration tools 
- Inefficient in-person care coordination that can burn too much expensive clinical time

Microsoft Teams enables physicians, clinicians, nurses, and other staff to collaborate efficiently by:

- Being part of a single virtualized team that works and collaborates on Office documents
- Having persistent conversations about different patients needing attention
- Using channels with tabs as a way to structure their work, with additional help from tabs to which they can pin information sources
- Using channel meetings with the power of Teams audio, video, screen sharing, recording, and transcription features to manage daily meetings
- Using the Microsoft Teams Patient App to curate a list of high-risk patients that must be monitored, and pulls their latest details from the EHR system.

The Patients App adds the following features to Microsoft Teams:

- Ability to fetch latest patient data from the EHRs and other medical information systems thru FHIR
- Ability to create multiple patient lists within a single channel.
- Ability to view and sort information displayed about patients through configurable columns.
- Ability to auto-provision the app through a team template.
- Available on the Teams App for iOS and Android for mobile first healthcare workers as well as Microsoft Teams web and desktop client.
- Support for FHIR DSTU2 and STU3 versions via parsing of conformance statement.

The Microsoft Teams Patients app is built on the Teams extensibility platform and takes advantage of the Tabs framework to display rich patient content within a channel. To learn more about other Teams apps and the platform itself, please see [Apps for Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-overview).  

Planned Patients app features include:

- Support for patient [messaging extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/messaging-extensions/messaging-extensions-overview) in channels and chat messages
- Support for notifications from Lab results, and Admit, Discharge & Transfer events.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Teams Patient App is in private preview and the FHIR interface is in beta. Released versions are not expected to be backward compatible.

This article is also for you if you're a general healthcare IT developer that is interested in using FHIR APIs on top of your medical information system to connect to Microsoft Teams to enable the above mentioned care coordination scenarios. This article documents the FHIR interface specifications for the Patients App. The article will also guide you through the step-by-step process of setting up FHIR server and connecting to the Patients App in your development environment\tenant. **Note: There are no steps in this process that use the Microsoft Teams admin center or PowerShell cmdlets to enable features.**

<<Insert Patients App Architecture Image>>

The following sections explain the requirements of the FHIR only data access layer for the Patients app that a FHIR server must meet in order to integrate with the Patients App, including the following:

- Functional and technical requirements of the integration interface
- Expectations around user authentication
- Expectations around performance and reliability
- Expectations around FHIR resources to be supported for the Patients App
- Process for integration and the expected engagement model
- How to enroll yourself and your customer in the private preview of the Patients App
- How to get started with FHIR adn some common challenges faced with the Patients App
- Future requirements for the next iteration of the Patient App

## DSTU2 interface specification

The FHIR server must support POST transactions using bundles for the following resources:

- [Patient](#patient)
- [Observation](#observation)
- [Condition](#observation)
- [Encounter](#encounter)
- [Allergy intolerance](#allergyintolerance)
- [Coverage](#coverage)
- [Medication order](#allergyintolerance)
- [Location](#location)

Queries from the Patient App for more than one resource shall post a bundle (BATCH) of requests to the FHIR server's URL. The server shall process each request and return a bundle of the resources matched by each request. For more information and examples, see [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#transaction](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#transaction).

All the following FHIR resources should be accessible by direct resource reference. For example, /Patient/id.

## Authentication and Authorization

Based on our understanding of working with Interop vendors that perform data transformations, the more commonly supported form of authorization is an app level authorization with no support for user level authorization even though the EHR system might implement user level authorization. The interop apps get a “God-Mode” level of access to the EHR data. The Interop Service (Partner) gets a “God-Mode” level of access to the EHR data. When they expose the same data as the appropriate FHIR resources there is no authorization context passed on to the ISVs who are integrating with the interop product or platform. When they expose the same data as the appropriate FHIR resources there is no authorization context passed on to the Interop Service Consumer (Ex: Microsoft Teams Patient App) who are integrating with the Interop Service or Platform. Hence, in such a case, Microsoft Teams Patients app will not be able to enforce user level authorization. We will rely on auditing to track actions of clinicians on auditing of ePHI data within the Patient App. 

In that model, we will support application to application authentication between the Microsoft Teams 1st Party Patient App and the Interop partner’s service. 

Authentication: Application to Application authentication model is described below: 

Service to service authentication should be done through oAuth 2.0 [Client Credential flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/). Partner service needs to provide the following: 

1. Partner service will enable Microsoft Teams Patient App to create an account with Partner, which will enable us to generate and own client_id and client_secret for Microsoft Teams Patient App, managed via an Auth registration portal on the partner’s Authentication server.
2. Partner service will own Authentication/Authorization system, which will accept and verify (authenticate) the client credentials provided and give back an access token with tenant hint in scope, as described below.
3. For security reasons or in a case of secret breach, Microsoft should be able to:
   1. Re-generate the secret
   2. Invalidate or delete the old secret (Example of the same is available in Azure Portal - AAD App Registration)
4. The metadata endpoint hosting the conformance statement should be un-authenticated, it should be accessible without authentication token.
5. Partner service will provide the token endpoint for Microsoft Teams Patient App to request an access token using client credential flow. The token url as per authorization server should be part of the FHIR conformance (capability) statement fetched from metadata on the FHIR server:
 
![patient app 5](../media/Patient-app-5.png)

A request for access token consists of the following parameters:

    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: authorization-server.com 
    
    grant-type=client_credentials
    &client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
    &client_secret-xxxxxxxxxx

Partner service will provide client_id and client_secret for Microsoft Teams Patient App, managed via an Auth registration portal on the partner’s side. Partner service will provide the endpoint to request access token using client credential flow. Example:

Successful response must include token_type, access_token and expires_in. 

## Routing: Mapping AAD Tenant to the Provider endpoint

Microsoft Teams Patient app will connect to partner service through a single endpoint. Partner service will have to own and maintain a mechanism to map Microsoft customer (AAD Tenant ID) to respective healthcare Provider (FHIR server) that Partner service is working with.

Mapping of AAD tenant to a provider endpoint should be done through AAD Tenant ID (GUID). Microsoft Teams Patient app will pass Tenant ID in scope, while requesting access-token for each request. Partner service will keep the mapping of Tenant ID to Provider endpoint and redirect request to a provider endpoint based on Tenant ID. To do this partner must support configuration on their end (manually or via a portal as part of onboarding of provider organizations to their Interop Platform).

Authentication and Routing work-flow is shown below:
