# Set your port out PIN

To transfer or *port out*  phone numbers from Microsoft Teams to another telephone service provider or carrier, you'll need to manually set a PIN. After you set the PIN, you need to include it when you request to port a phone number out. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A port out PIN is only used for organizations in the United States.
  
See [Transfer phone numbers to Teams](transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams.md) for more information about transferring and porting in/out phone numbers.
  
Here's some specific information about this PIN you should know:
  
- If a PIN isn't set, you won't be able to transfer or port out phone numbers from Teams.
    
- It can contain 6-10 digits (numbers).
    
- It can't contain letters or special characters.
    
- The default PIN is blank, but if you put one in, you can't remove or set it back to blank.
    
- You can update or change the PIN after you put one in.
    
## Set up your PIN

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Microsoft Teams admin center** > **Legacy portal**.
    
3. In the left navigation, choose **Voice** > **Port orders**.
    
4. Click **Set up and manage the PIN** that is used for transferring or porting numbers to another service carrier.
    
5. In the **Set or change your port out PIN** panel, enter your PIN and click **Save**.
