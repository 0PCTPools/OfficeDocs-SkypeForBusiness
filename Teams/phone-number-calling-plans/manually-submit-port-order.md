# Manually submit a port order

If you have service numbers for dial-in conferencing bridges, auto attendants or other service numbers, toll-free phone numbers or if you have more than 999 user (subscriber) phone numbers that you want to transfer to Microsoft Teams, you need to [manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization).

In some countries and regions, you also have to manually submit a service request if you want to get phone numbers, release the numbers, or change addresses. To see what's required for each country and region or to learn more about number porting, see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization). 

Use the steps in this article to manually create and submit a port order in scenarios where you can't do so by using the [porting wizard in the Microsoft Teams admin center](transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams.md). 

## Manually create and submit a port order

You can manually submit a port order by creating a service request in the Microsoft 365 admin center or by emailing the PSTN service desk for your region directly.

### Submit a service request in the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Support** > **New service request**.  If you don't see **Support** listed, add it by going to **Customize navigation** in the left navigation, and then select the **Support** check box.
2. In the **Need help?** pane, select **Contact support**.
3. In the **Contact support** pane, do the following:

    1. Enter a title (for example, Port order request) and description for your request, confirm your phone number and email address, and select your preferred contact method.
    2. Under **Attachments**, click **Add a file**, and then upload your completed [Letter of Authorization (LOA)](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md#letters-of-authorization-loas-for-transferring-numbers).
    3. Click **Contact me**.

### Send your Letter of Authorization directly to the PSTN service desk

Download the [Letter of Authorization (LOA)](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md#letters-of-authorization-loas-for-transferring-numbers), complete the form, and then send it to the [PSTN service desk](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-pstn-service-desk.md) for your region:

    - In the U.S., [send your request](mailto:ptn@microsoft.com).
    - In Europe, [send your request](mailto:ptneu@microsoft.com).
    - In Asia, [send your request](mailto:ptnapac@microsoft.com).
