# Create and license users and assign phone numbers to them

To use Microsoft 365 Business Voice, a user needs an Microsoft 365 account with a Microsoft 365 Business Voice with SMS license. After an account has been created with a Microsoft 365 Business Voice with SMS license, you can assign a phone number to it.

## Create and license users

1. Follow the steps in [Add users individually or in bulk to Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add one or more users.
2. In the **Assign product licenses** pane, be sure to select **Microsoft 365 Business Voice with SMS**.

## Assign phone numbers to users

After users have been created and assigned a Microsoft 365 Business Voice with SMS license, you can assign phone numbers to them. You need one unassigned phone number for each user that needs one. If you don't have enough unassigned phone numbers, see [Get more phone numbers](#get-more-phone-numbers) later in this article.

1. Go to https://admin.teams.microsoft.com
2. Enter a name and description for the phone number request
3. Select **Voice** > **Phone numbers**
4. Select a phone number you want to assign to a user and select **Edit**
5. In the **Edit** panel, enter the name of the user you want to assign the number to in **Assigned to** and select **Assign**
6. In **Emergency location**, enter the location where the user is located, and then select **Apply**


## Get more phone numbers

If you don't have enough phone numbers to assign to new users, you can get more. After you've placed your order, it might take up to 24 hours for the numbers to become available.

1. Go to https://admin.teams.microsoft.com
2. Enter a name and description for the phone number request
3. Select **Voice** > **Phone numbers**, and then **Add**
4. Choose the country or region where the phone number should be created
5. In **Number type**, select **User (subscriber)**
6. In **Location**, search for the location of the user and select it. If you need to add a new location, select **Add a location**
7. Choose an area code, enter the number of phone numbers to get, and then click **Next**
8. Wait for the phone numbers to be reserved, review the numbers chosen and then, if everything looks ok, select **Place order** and then **Finish**.
