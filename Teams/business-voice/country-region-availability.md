# Country and region availability for Business Voice

Microsoft 365 Business Voice is available in over 70 countries and regions. Whether Business Voice includes a [Domestic Calling Plan](what-to-buy.md#domestic-calling-plan) or not depends on the country or region in which your organization is located. Take a look at the table below to see if Business Voice is available in your country or region and whether Calling Plan is included or not.

To see what's included in Business Voice with Calling Plan and without Calling Plan, see [Microsoft 365 Business Voice Service Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-business-voice-service-description).
