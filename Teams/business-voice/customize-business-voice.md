# Customize Microsoft 365 Business Voice

The Getting Started wizard sets up Business Voice with basic options so that you can use it right away. Those options might be enough if you're a small business just starting out or if you're running a pilot in your larger organization; you get new phone numbers, a call menu, and so on. But more than likely, you'll need to do some customization so that Business Voice meets the needs of your business. For example, you'll probably want to move your existing phone numbers (called number porting) to Business Voice.
