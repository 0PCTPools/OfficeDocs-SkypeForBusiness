# Use the Getting Started wizard to set up Business Voice

The Getting Started wizard for Microsoft 365 Business Voice gives you an easy and quick way to start receiving and making phone calls in Microsoft Teams. If you're a small business just starting out, the wizard can get you up and running in a few minutes with phone numbers, call menus, greetings, and more. If you're a larger business with an established telephony solution, the wizard can help you set up a Business Voice pilot so you can try it out with a few users before you set it up for everyone. Either way, you can start using Business Voice as soon as the wizard is finished!

It's a good idea to read this article before you start the wizard. When you're ready, you can open the wizard from the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/homepage). Make sure you sign in either with the account you used to create your subscription or another account that's a Global Administrator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Teams and Business Voice only work when your users' mailboxes are located in Microsoft 365.  We don't support mailboxes located on on-premises Exchange server.

<!-- After you've finished the wizard, here are a couple articles you can check out to see what you can do with Business Voice and learn how to customize it. If you don't want to customize anything, you're done! You can start using Business Voice right away.

## Emergency services location

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>If you'd like to change the emergency address, click <b>Edit</b> and enter a new address. The address you provide is validated to make sure that it's legitimate and correctly formatted for emergency response services. If it's valid, the address is assigned to all of the users you assign a number to in the next step. If you have employees in more than one location, the Customize Business Voice topic will show you how to add and assign more emergency addresses after you finish the Getting Started wizard.

## Company phone number

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>In addition to setting up a new phone local phone number, you can choose to purchase a toll-free number or port an existing number to Microsoft 365. If you choose to set up a toll-free number, you'll need to purchase a calling plan. If you want to port a number to Microsoft 365, you'll have an option to do so in the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) after the wizard completes.

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to port an existing phone number to Microsoft 365, you'll still see a temporary phone number in the wizard. This is ok. After you complete the wizard, and you complete the porting process, the temporary phone number will be replaced with your phone number.

## Assigning licenses to users

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Select the people in your organization that want to make or receive phone calls outside of Teams (such as calling a supplier). You can select up to the number of available Business Voice licenses you have available. If you need more, you can buy additional licenses when the wizard is finished.

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to port existing phone numbers to Microsoft 365 for individual users, you can do so after the wizard is complete. After you complete the porting process, the ported phone numbers will replace the temporary phone numbers selected by the wizard.

## Incoming call greeting

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>You can upload a sound file (MP3 or WAV) that's up to 5 Megabytes (MB) to use as a greeting, or you can type out your greeting and Microsoft 365 will use text-to-speech to read it to a caller. The greeting will be the first time callers hear when they call your company phone number. You might need to mis-spell the words or use phonetic spellings to get the pronunciations correct.

    </tr>
</table>

## Call menu and forwarding

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>You can forward all calls to a specific user, or you can set up a call menu they can choose options from. If you create a call menu, you can specify options that a caller can select either by pressing a number on a phone's keypad, or by speaking the option via the voice command. Each menu option can be forwarded to one user. <br>
        You can choose whether to upload a sound file (MP3 or WAV) that's up to 5MB that gives instructions to the caller or you can type out the instructions instead. Microsoft 365 will use text-to-speech to read the instructions to the caller. You might need to spell words phonetically to get the pronunciations right.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td> <p>On the <b>Overview</b> page, the Getting Started wizard takes everything you've entered and sets up Business Voice for you. You can see what phone numbers will be assigned to your users, take a look at your call menu, listen to your greeting, and more. </p>
             <p>Setting up Business Voice takes several minutes. You can click on <b>Done</b> and we'll continue to set up Business Voice in the background, or you can wait until it's finished. After it's finished, go to <b>Voice</b> in the <a href="http://admin.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Teams admin center</a> to set up more Business Voice features.</p>
