# Move (port) phone numbers to Business Voice

When the Getting Started wizard sets up Business Voice, it assigns phone numbers for the main company phone line and for any users you assigned a Business Voice license to. If you already have phone numbers that you want to keep when you move to Business Voice, you can bring them with you using a process called phone number porting. When you port your phone numbers to Business Voice, you can assign them to users and services, replacing the temporary numbers set up by the Getting Started wizard.

Before you move numbers to Business Voice, take a look at [Transferring phone numbers common questions](../transferring-phone-numbers-common-questions.md). The article includes answers to questions including what countries or regions are supported, what numbers can and can't be transferred, what information you'll need, and so on.

When you're ready to move phone numbers to Business Voice, follow the steps in [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](../transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365.md) to create a port order. A port order includes all the information needed to move your numbers from your current carrier to Business Voice.

After your phone numbers have been moved to Business Voice, you need to assign them to people. To do that, follow the steps in [Change a phone number for a user](../assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user.md#change-a-phone-number-for-a-user). When you follow these steps, you'll replace the phone number temporarily assigned to the user with their original phone number.
