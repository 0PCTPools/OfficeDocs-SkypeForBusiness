# Move (port) phone numbers to Business Voice

When the Getting Started wizard sets up Business Voice, it assigns phone numbers for the main company phone line and for any users that you assigned a Business Voice license to. If you have pre-exisinting phone numbers that you want to keep when you move to Business Voice, you can use a process called phone number porting. When you port your phone numbers to Business Voice, you assign them to users and services, replacing the temporary numbers that were set up by the Getting Started wizard.

Before you move numbers to Business Voice, take a look at [Transferring phone numbers common questions](../transferring-phone-numbers-common-questions.md). The article provides information like what countries and regions are supported, what numbers can and can't be transferred, and what information you'll need.

When you're ready to move your phone numbers to Business Voice, follow the steps in [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](../transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365.md) to create a port order. A port order includes the information that's needed to move your numbers from your current phone service carrier to Business Voice.

After your phone numbers have been moved to Business Voice, you re-assign them to people. To do that, follow the steps in [Change a phone number for a user](../assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user.md#change-a-phone-number-for-a-user). This procedure replaces the phone number that was temporarily assigned to the user with their original phone number that you ported over.

If you need help porting your numbers to Business Voice, send us a request. Be sure to include your organization ID (such as ***contoso***.onmicrosoft.com), what types and how many numbers you need help with, the authorizing person on your account, and a description of the issue or question that you have.
