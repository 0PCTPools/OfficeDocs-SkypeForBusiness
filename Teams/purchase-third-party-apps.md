Purchase third-party apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center
======================================================

The [Manage apps page](manage-apps.md) in the Microsoft Teams admin center is where you view and manage all Teams apps in your organization's app catalog. You can see the org-level status and properties of apps, upload new custom apps to your tenant app catalog, block or allow apps at the org level, and manage org-wide app settings.

Here, you can also search for and purchase licenses for third-party apps for users in your organization. The **Licenses** column in the table indicates whether an app offers a SaaS subscription for purchase.

You must be a global admin or Teams service admin to access the page.

## Search for and purchase a third-party app

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.
2. Search for the app that you want. Look in the **Licenses** column to identify apps that have a paid SaaS subscription. Each app will display one of the following values: 
    - **Purchase now**: The app offers a SaaS subscription and is available to purchase.  
    - **Purchased**: The app offers a SaaS subscription and you've purchased licenses for it.
    - **- -**: The app doesn't offer a SaaS subscription.
3. Click **Purchase now**. 
4. On the **Plans and pricing** tab of the app details page, review the plans and pricing information. If you need more information, click the **learn more** link to go to the app's page in [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).  
5. When you're ready to buy the app, click **Purchase now**.
6.
