# What is a Resource Account?

A Resource Account is also known as a disabled user object in Azure AD, and can be used to represent resources. In Exchange it might be used to represent conference rooms. A resource account can be homed in Microsoft 365 or on premises using Skype for Business server, and these accounts are created using Powershell commands.

In Microsoft Teams, an admin can use a resource account to:

- Assign a phone number to a  Call Queue or Auto Attendant
- license check
