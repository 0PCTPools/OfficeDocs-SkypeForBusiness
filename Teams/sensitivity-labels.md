# Sensitivity labels for Microsoft Teams

[Sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) allow Teams admins to regulate access to sensitive organizational content created during collaboration within teams. Admins can define sensitivity labels and their associated policies in the [Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/go-to-the-securitycompliance-center). These labels and policies are automatically applied to teams in your organization.
