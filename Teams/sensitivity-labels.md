# Sensitivity labels for Microsoft Teams

[Sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) allow Teams admins to regulate access to sensitive organizational content created during collaboration within teams. You can define sensitivity labels and their associated policies in the [Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/go-to-the-securitycompliance-center). These labels and policies are automatically applied to teams in your organization.  

## What's the difference between sensitivity labels and Teams classification labels?

Sensitivity labels are different from classification labels that require you to create them using PowerShell. Classification labels are text strings that can be associated with a group but don't have any actual policies associated with them. You use classification labels as metadata to manually enforce policies through internal tools and scripts.

On the other hand, sensitivity labels and their policies are automatically enforced end-to-end through a combination of the Groups platform, Security & Compliance Center, and Teams services. Sensitivity labels provide powerful infrastructure support for securing your organization's sensitive data.
