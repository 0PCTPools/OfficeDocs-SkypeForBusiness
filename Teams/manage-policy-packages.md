# Manage policy packages in Microsoft Teams

Policy packages in Microsoft Teams are predefined collections of policies and policy settings that you can assign to users in your organization. Policy packages let you control features that you want to allow or restrict for sets of people in your organization. You can customize the policy settings within each policy in a collection to meet your organization's needs.  

For example, you can use the Education_Teacher policy package to apply a collection of policies that apply to all teachers in your school.
