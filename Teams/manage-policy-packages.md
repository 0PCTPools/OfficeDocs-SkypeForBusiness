# Manage policy packages in Microsoft Teams

Policy packages in Microsoft Teams are collections of predefined policies and policy settings that you can assign to users who have similar roles in your organization. Policy packages are designed to simplify, streamline, and help provide consistency when managing policies for groups of users across your organization.  

When you assign a policy package to users, the policies in the package are created and you can then customize the settings in each policy to meet your organization's needs.

For example, you can use the Education_Teacher policy package to assign policies that apply to all teachers in your school.

## How to use policy packages

It's important to know that the policies in a policy package aren't created until you assign the package to users, after which you can change the settings in each policy. 

You can view the settings of individual policies within a package on the View only page. If you haven't assigned the policy package to a user or if the policy in a package is deleted, you won't be able to make changes to the settings of the policy. 

The following steps outline how to use a policy package in your organization.

> We'll be adding more policy packages to Teams, so check back for the most up-to-date information.  

## Policies included in a policy package

There are five different policies that are created when you assign users to a policy package. The policies include the name of policy package so you can easily identify the policy that is linked to a policy package. You can edit the settings of each policy using the Policy packages icon or in each individual policy type in the left navigation ofthe Teams admin center. Here are the individual policies that are created:

- **Messaging policy** - Messaging policies are used to control which chat and channel messaging features are available to users in Microsoft Teams. [Learn more](messaging-policies-in-teams.md)
- **Meeting policy** - Meeting policies are used to control the features that are available to meeting participants for meetings that are scheduled by users in your organization.  [Learn more](meeting-policies-in-teams.md)
- **App setup policy** - @Lana - Insert description and link. I cant find the correct doc.
- **Calling policy** - Calling policies control which calling and call forwarding features are available to users. [Learn more](teams-calling-policy.md)
- **Live events policy** - Live event policies are used to control what features such as transcriptions for attendees, allow scheduling and other features are available to users that are assigned the policy. [Learn more](teams-live-events/set-up-for-teams-live-events.md)

## View-only page
You can use this page to view the settings of a specific policy that is linked to this policy package. If you haven't assigned the policy package to a user or if the policy linked to the package policy has been deleted or renamed you won't be able to make changes to the settings of the policy. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When a policy is deleted or renamed but is linked to a policy package, and you can only view policy settings another 'new' policy with the right name will be created again.
