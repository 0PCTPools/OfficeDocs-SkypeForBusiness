# Manage policy packages in Microsoft Teams
A policy package is a collection with a set predefined policies and settings that can be applied to users that have similar roles within your organization. When you assign a policy package to users, the policies defined within the policy package are created and you can then click on the policy package link to view and customize settings for each of the policies.

##What are policy packages?

Teams creates policy packages designed to simplify, streamline, and to help provide consistency when managing policies for groups of users across your organization.

There are four steps that you will go through as an admin in Teams to use policy packages in your organization.

##View-only page
You can use this page to view the settings of a specific policy that is linked to this policy package. If you haven't assigned the policy package to a user or if the policy linked to the package policy has been deleted or renamed you won't be able to make changes to the settings of the policy. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When a policy is deleted or renamed but is linked to a policy package, and you can only view policy settings another 'new' policy with the right name will be created again.
