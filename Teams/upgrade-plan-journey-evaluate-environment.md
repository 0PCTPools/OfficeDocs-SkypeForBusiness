This article is part of the Technical Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the User Readiness stage. Before proceeding, confirm that youâ€™ve completed these activities from previous stages:

-   [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
-   [Defined your project scope](upgrade-define-project-scope.md)
-   [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](upgrade-understand-coexistence-and-interoperability.md)

# Evaluate your environment before upgrading to Teams

This article gives an overview of the requirements for properly evaluating your current environment for operating Teams. By evaluating your environment, you identify risks and requirements that will influence your overall deployment. By identifying these items beforehand, you can adjust your planning to drive success.

## Introduction to evaluating your environment 

To achieve your objective key results (OKRs), you previously made key service decisions. The next step is to perform environmental discovery to evaluate all aspects relating to your IT infrastructure, networking, and operations to confirm that your organization is ready to implement the solution. Environmental discovery must include a network readiness assessment to ensure your network can support upgrading to Teams.

You identify technical risks as part of an environmental assessment and adoption readiness evaluation, and develop a mitigation plan for each identified risk. You should incorporate this information in the risk register.


## Current environment

As part of your environmental discovery, include all matters related to end-user computing, such as a readiness assessment of PCs and mobile devices to support Teams business use cases, from hardware requirements to software requirements.

You can use the questionnaire in [Environmental discovery for a Microsoft Teams rollout](upgrade-prepare-environment-discover-environment.md) to perform environmental discovery.
