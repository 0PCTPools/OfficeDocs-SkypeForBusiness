![Stages of the upgrade journey, with emphasis on the Technical Readiness stage](media/upgrade-banner-tech-readiness.png "Stages of the upgrade journey, with emphasis on the Technical Readiness stage")

This article is part of the Technical Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the User Readiness stage. 

# Evaluate my environment

This article gives an overview of the requirements for properly evaluating your current environment for using cloud voice services. By evaluating your environment, you identify risks and requirements that will influence your overall cloud voice deployment. By identifying these items beforehand, you can adjust your planning to drive success.

## Introduction to evaluating your environment 

To achieve your objective key results (OKRs), you previously made key service decisions. The next step is to perform environmental discovery to evaluate all aspects relating to your IT and telephony infrastructure, networking, and operations to confirm that your organization is ready to implement the solution.

Environmental discovery must include network readiness assessment to ensure your network can support the implementation of the Audio Conferencing or Phone System with Calling Plan services.

You identify technical risks as part of an environmental assessment and adoption readiness evaluation, and develop a mitigation plan for each identified risk. You should incorporate this information in the risk register.

## Current environment

As part of your environmental discovery, include all matters related to end-user computing, such as a readiness assessment of PCs and mobile devices to support Audio Conferencing and Phone System with Calling Plan business use cases, from hardware requirements to software requirements.

You can use the [Environmental discovery for Microsoft Teams rollout](upgrade-prepare-environment-discover-environment.md) to perform environmental discovery.

## Adoption and change management assessment capabilities 

Deployment puts a new technology at a user's fingertips, but business results are only realized after users truly adopt that solution as their own. To help ensure sustained adoption of a new solution, you'll need to focus your efforts on user readiness and change management. For optimal results, conduct user readiness planning as a parallel workstream to your technical readiness activities and incorporate the following activities:

-   **Organizational and user profiling:** Analysis of organizational receptiveness to change in addition to use case and persona analysis

-   **Readiness and resource preparation:** Creation of targeted and broad-reach awareness, training, and support resources, including focused value messaging to accelerate user buy-in

Use the following considerations to assess your organizationâ€™s preparedness to address user change management.
