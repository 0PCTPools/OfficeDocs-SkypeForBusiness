This article is part of the Technical Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the User Readiness stage. Before proceeding, confirm that you’ve completed these activities from previous stages:

-   [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
-   [Defined your project scope](upgrade-define-project-scope.md)
-   [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](upgrade-understand-coexistence-and-interoperability.md)

# Evaluate your environment before upgrading to Teams

This article gives an overview of the requirements for properly evaluating your current environment for operating Teams post-upgrade. By evaluating your environment, you identify risks and requirements that will influence your overall deployment. By identifying these items beforehand, you can adjust your planning to drive success.

## Introduction to evaluating your environment 

To achieve your objective key results (OKRs), you previously made key service decisions. The next step is to perform environmental discovery to evaluate all aspects relating to your IT infrastructure, networking, and operations to confirm that your organization is ready to implement the solution. Environmental discovery must include a network readiness assessment to ensure your network can support upgrading to Teams.

You identify technical risks as part of an environmental assessment and adoption readiness evaluation, and develop a mitigation plan for each identified risk. You should incorporate this information in the risk register.

## Current environment

As part of your environmental discovery, include all matters related to end-user computing, such as a readiness assessment of PCs and mobile devices to support Teams business use cases, from hardware requirements to software requirements.

You can use the questionnaire in [Environmental discovery for a Microsoft Teams rollout](upgrade-prepare-environment-discover-environment.md) to perform environmental discovery.

## Adoption and change management assessment capabilities 

Deployment puts a new technology at a user’s fingertips, but business results are only realized after users truly adopt that solution as their own. To help ensure sustained adoption of a new solution, you’ll need to focus your efforts on user readiness and change management. For optimal results, conduct user readiness planning as a parallel workstream to your technical readiness activities and incorporate the following activities:

-   **Organizational and user profiling:** Analysis of organizational receptiveness to change in addition to use case and persona analysis

-   **Readiness and resource preparation:** Creation of targeted and broad-reach awareness, training, and support resources, including focused value messaging to accelerate user buy-in

Use the following considerations to assess how prepared your organization is to address user change management.

<tr><td>![](media/audio_conferencing_image9.png)<br/>Next steps</td><td><ul><li>If you answered “yes” to all of the above, identify the right user change management stakeholders and begin your user readiness planning.</li><li>If you answered “no” to some or all of the above, consider engaging outside resources to assist with driving change management and adoption-related activities for your organization.</li></ol></td></tr>
