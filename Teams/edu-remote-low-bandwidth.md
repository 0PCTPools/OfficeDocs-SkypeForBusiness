# Help for low bandwidth situations for Teams for EDU

There are a lot of network elements when it comes to working with Microsoft Teams that can affect performance, and low bandwidth is one of the things that can feel entirely out of your control. Consider the following:

- A low-speed internet connection for the school.
- A low-speed internet connection for one or more students.
- Times of the day when there is low bandwidth due to network usage in an area.
- Low bandwidth periods due to outages local to neither the school nor to students, but which impact performance nonetheless.

This article will give you best practices to follow for a variety of Teams activities when you're faced with a low-bandwidth issue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's information here on [How Microsoft Teams uses memory](teams-memory-usage-perf.md), because in addition to low bandwidth problems, you may be having resource issues on your device. If you're looking for network guidance for Microsoft Teams, review [Prepare your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](prepare-network.md).

## Resolving low bandwidth issues for ITAdmins

The important thing to remember, as an ITAdmin, is that while you have solutions that are wide-spread that will resolve problems quickly, this should be considered carefully, as some issues may be able to resolved with a more narrow focus taken at the educator or even the student/parent level.

In short, if the low bandwidth issue occurs for a wide group of students, taking action as an ITAdmin makes sense, and it also makes sense if the actions taken at the student/educator level haven't been helpful.

### Meetings and video

A primary focus for low bandwidth issues are meetings, and specifically video in meetings.

Meeting policies - disable IT video so video can't be turned on.

Provide a dial-in number for meetings, so they can phone in as an alternative to attending a video meeting. A good option for areas of mixed bandwidth.

## Low bandwidth scenarios as an educator

Educators should feel empowered to take steps to resolve low bandwidth issues, and may be a superior choice to ITAdmin action in the following situations:

- If the problem is intermittent, or relatively transitory.
- If there is a specific time of the day you can anticipate there being an issue, or the low bandwidth period has some predictability to it.

In these situations, you can take some actions.

## Low bandwidth scenarios as a parent or student

There are also situations, and you should proactively discuss them with your educators, where the bandwidth problem may be on the student's side (for example, a large number of students are able to watch the video lessons without issue, but a small number of students have difficulties).

It's not reasonable to expect many parents to be able to troubleshoot these issues, and low bandwidth issues may be out of a student or parent's control (their home may not have access to high bandwidth, they may have a lot of people in their immediate area consuming bandwidth and affecting what they can do, there may be internet instability, and so on).
