# Help for low bandwidth situations for Teams for EDU

There are a lot of network elements when it comes to working with Microsoft Teams that can affect performance, and low bandwidth is one of the things that can feel entirely out of your control. Consider the following:

- A low-speed internet connection for the school.
- A low-speed internet connection for one or more students.
- Times of the day when there is low bandwidth due to network usage in an area.
- Low bandwidth periods due to outages local to neither the school nor to students, but which impact performance nonetheless.

This article will give you best practices to follow for a variety of Teams activities when you're faced with a low-bandwidth issue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's further information here on [How Microsoft Teams uses memory](teams-memory-usage-perf.md). If you're looking for network guidance for Microsoft Teams, review [Prepare your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](prepare-network.md).
