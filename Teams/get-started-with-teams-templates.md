# Get started with Teams templates 

Teams templates are pre-built definitions of a team's structure designed around a business need or project. You can use Teams templates to quickly create rich collaboration spaces with channels for different topics and preinstall apps to pull in mission-critical content and services. Teams templates provide a predefined team structure that can help you easily create consistent teams across your organization. 

In this article, we'll explain the properties that can be defined in templates, what base template types are, and how you can use a few sample requests to create a team from a template.
 
This article is for you if you're:

- Responsible for planning, deploying, and managing multiple teams across your organization<br>
- A developer wanting to programmatically create a team with predefined channels and apps 

## Teams template capabilities

Most properties in a team are included and supported by templates. But there are a few properties and features that are not currently supported. The following table provides a quick summary of what's included and what's not included in Teams templates.

| **Team properties supported by Teams templates** | **Team properties not yet supported by Teams templates** |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base template type | Team membership |
| Team name | Team picture |
| Team description | Channel settings |
| Team visibility (public or private) | Connectors |
| Team settings (for example, member, guest, @ mentions) | Files and content |
| Auto-favorite channel | |
| Installed app | |
| Pinned tabs | | 

> [!NOTE]
> We'll be adding more template capabilities in future releases of Microsoft Teams, so check back for the most up-to-date information on supported properties.

## What are base template types?

Base template types are special templates that Microsoft created for specific industries. These base templates often contain proprietary apps that aren't available in the store and team properties that are not yet supported individually in Teams templates.

Once a base template type is defined, you can extend or override these special templates with additional properties that you'd like to specify. But some base template types contain properties that can't be overridden. 

By default the base template is set to **Standard** which doesn't contain any additional proprietary apps or special properties. Below is the current list of base templates types available.

| Base template type | baseTemplateId | Base template proprietary apps and special properties |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard | `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams`<br>`Templates/standard` | No additional apps and properties |
| Education - <br>Class team<sup>1</sup> | `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams`<br>`Templates/educationClass` | Apps:<ul><li>OneNote Class Notebook (pinned to the **General** tab) </li><li>Assignments app (pinned to the **General** tab)</li></ul> Team properties:<ul><li>Team visibility set to **HiddenMembership** (cannot be overridden)</li></ul> |
