# Getting phone numbers for your users

Before you can set up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must get phone numbers for them.
  
There are three ways to get new user numbers:

- **Use the Microsoft Teams admin center.** For some countries/regions, you can get numbers for your users using the Microsoft Teams admin center, see "Get new phone numbers for your users," below.
    
- **Port your existing numbers.** You can port or transfer existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier to Office 365. See [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](/microsoftteams/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365) or [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) for more information to help you do this.  
  
- **Use a request form for new numbers.** Sometimes (depending on your country/region) you won't be able to get your new phone numbers using the Microsoft Teams admin center, or you'll need specific phone numbers or area codes. If so, you'll need to download a form and send it back to us. See [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) for more information.
    
You must use the **Get phone numbers** page to see, search, get, and reserve those numbers. You specify country or region, number type, and location, and then enter the number of phone numbers you'll need for your users.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you need help setting up phone numbers for your organization, you can [contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b). 
  
## Get new phone numbers for your users

![An icon showing the Microsoft Teams logo](media/teams-logo-30x30.png) **Using the Microsoft Teams admin center**
    
1. In the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers**, and then click **Get new numbers**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
2. Enter a name for the order and if you want, add a description.
3. On the Location and quantity page, do the following:
    1. Under **Country or region**, select a country or region.
    1. Under **Number type**, select the type of number that you want.
    1. Under **Location**, select a location. If you need to create a new location, click **Add a location**.
    1. Under **Area code**, select an area code. 
    2. Under **Quantity**, enter the number of numbers that you want for your organization, and then click **Next** to select your numbers.
4. Select the numbers you want. You can click **Show numbers** to see the full list of phone numbers. This is helpful is you don't want to select a specific phone number in the list.

You have 10 minutes to select your phone numbers and place your order. If you take more than 10 minutes, the phone numbers will be returned to the pool of numbers.

 > [!NOTE]
    > You can see the number of phone numbers, which is based on the number of licenses, listed next to **Total user numbers you can acquire**. For details, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](/microsoftteams/how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get)
5. When you're ready to place your order, click **Place order**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The number of phone numbers for users (subscribers) is equal to the total number of **Domestic Calling Plan** and/or **Domestic and International Calling Plan** licenses you have assigned multiplied by 1.1, plus 10 additional phone numbers. For example, if you have 50 users in total with a Domestic Calling Plan and/or Domestic and International Calling Plan, you can acquire **65** phone numbers **(50 x 1.1 + 10)**. For details, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](/microsoftteams/how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get). If you need to get more telephone numbers than this, please contact [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b). 
  
   **Port or transfer phone numbers from your service provider or phone carrier**
  
- If you need 999 or fewer phone numbers for your users, you can use the porting wizard in the Microsoft Teams admin center. Follow the steps in [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](/microsoftteams/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365) to transfer your phone numbers to Teams.
    
- If you need to port more than 999 phone numbers, see [Manually submit a custom service request](/skypeforbusiness/manually-submit-a-custom-service-request) to submit a port order service request or order to get all of these phone numbers ported over to Office 365.
    
## Show phone numbers for your organization

![An icon showing the Microsoft Teams logo](media/teams-logo-30x30.png) **Using the Microsoft Teams admin center**
In the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers** to view the numbers for your organization, including location, number type, and status information.
  
## What else do you need to know about users' phone numbers?

- To get phone numbers, you must use the **Add new user numbers** page to see, search, and reserve those numbers. You can search by Country/Region, State/Region and City and then enter the number of phone numbers you'll need for your users. 
    
- After you get your phone numbers, you'll need to assign a number to each of your users. See [Assign, change, or remove a phone number for a user](/microsoftteams/assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user).
    
- You can use the **Phone numbers** page to see the list of available phone numbers in the **Number** column, see whether the phone number has been assigned in the **Assigned** column, and see the location for the phone number in the **Number location** column.
