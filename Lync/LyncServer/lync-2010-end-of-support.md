# Lync Server 2010 end of support roadmap

*This article applies to both Office 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Enterprise.*

On **October 13, 2020**,  Lync Server 2010 will reach end of support. If you haven't already begun your migration from Lync Server 2010 to Teams or Skype for Business 2015, now's the time to start your planning.

## What does end of support mean?

Lync Server, like almost all Microsoft products, has a support lifecycle during which we provide new features, bug fixes, security fixes, and so on. This lifecycle typically lasts for 10 years from the date of the product's initial release, and the end of this lifecycle is known as the product's end of support. When Lync Server 2010 reaches its end of support on October 13, 2020, Microsoft will no longer provide:

- Technical support for problems that may occur;
- Bug fixes for issues that are discovered and that may impact the stability and usability of the server;
- Security fixes for vulnerabilities that are discovered and that may make the server vulnerable to security breaches;
- Time zone updates.

Your installation of Lync Server 2010 will continue to run after this date. However, because of the changes listed above, we strongly recommend that you migrate from Lync Server 2010 as soon as possible.

For more information about Lync 2010 servers nearing the end of support, see [Resources to help you upgrade from Office 2010 servers and clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/upgrade-from-office-2010-servers-and-products).

## What are my options?

With Lync Server 2010 reaching its end of support, this is a great time to explore your options and prepare a migration plan. You can:

**Option 1**: Migrate to Microsoft Teams. *This is the recommended path.*

**Option 2**: Upgrade to Skype for Business 2015

The following sections explore each option in more detail.

## Option 1: Migrate to Microsoft Teams 
Two possible paths for migrating to Microsoft Teams are:

1. Move to Skype for Business Online, and then switch to Teams. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only choose this option if you **do not** have on premisis voice.

2. Upgrade to Skype for Business Server 2015 CU8, and then switch to Teams.


## Option 2: Upgrade to Skype for Business Server 2015
