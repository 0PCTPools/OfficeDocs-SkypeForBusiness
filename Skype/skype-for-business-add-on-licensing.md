Need to talk to someone about all the add-on options?  [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b%28Office.14%29.aspx)
Skype for Business licensing is designed to give you the maximum amount of flexibility. For example, after using basic Skype for Business features for a while, you can buy add-on licenses when you're ready to use more features, such as dial-in conferencing, or Cloud PBX.
  
    
    

 **Looking for prices?** See [How to see prices and buy add-on licenses](skype-for-business-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_how).
## What are add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Skype for Business features. Some businesses want the flexibility of purchasing only specific features at a competitive price. To add a feature, buy 1 add-on license for each user who is going to use it.
  
    
    
 **How does add-on licensing affect cost?** For most businesses, buying a bundle of software in an Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with higher combined cost.
  
    
    

## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Depending on which plan you already have, you can buy add-on licenses for the following Skype for Business features:
  
    
    

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Feature** <br/> |**Description** <br/> |
|**Dial-in conferencing** (also called PSTN conferencing) <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call into a Skype for Business meeting, instead of using their computer. Use the dial-in conferencing feature for this situation.  <br/> To find out whether dial-in or PSTN conferencing is available in your country or region, see  [Is PSTN Conferencing with phone numbers available in my country or region?](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/1096d81e-7e14-488c-95d8-b8322e39c059%28Office.14%29.aspx) <br/> |
|**Toll free numbers for dial-in access to your conferences, and the ability to dial out from a conference to add someone by calling any telephone number in the world** <br/> |If you add dial-in conferencing, you can get this feature by  [How to sign up for PSTN Consumption billing](skype-for-business-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_billing) for PSTN Consumption billing. [What is PSTN Consumption billing?](what-is-pstn-consumption-billing.md) <br/> |
|**Cloud PBX** <br/> |A PBX is a telephone system in a business. Cloud PBX is a hosted telephone service in Office 365. It gives you both traditional and innovative PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment.  [Here's what you get with Cloud PBX](here-s-what-you-get-with-cloud-pbx.md).  <br/> |
|**PSTN calling telephone service** <br/> |Calls to other Skype for Business users are free, but if you want your users to be able to call any phone numbers outside of your business, get the  [PSTN Calling plans for Skype for Business](pstn-calling-plans-for-skype-for-business.md).  <br/> |
|**Skype Room Systems v2** <br/> |This isn't an add-on, but a feature that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. See  [Licensing for Skype Room Systems v2](skype-for-business-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_srs).  <br/> |
   

## Guidance for Office 365 Business Premium Plan customers

If you have  [Office 365 Business Premium](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business-premium), you can use Skype for Business to make calls to other people in your business who are on your subscription. For example, if your business has 10 people, you can call and IM each other using Skype for Business.
  
    
    
 **To make and receive calls from people external to your business, you have two options**:
  
    
    

- **Option 1. Use the free  [Skype app](https://www.skype.com/)**. If you have a very small business (for example, 1-2 people) using the Skype app is the better way to go. It's less expensive to use for domestic and international calls. You can still hold conference calls, make video calls, and share your desktop for presentations. [Check out the rates and payment options](https://secure.skype.com/en/calling-rates?wt.mc_id=legacy&amp;expo365=bundled).
    
    Note that the Skype app isn't part of the Office 365 suite, so it won't be integrated with Outlook 2016 the way Skype for Business is. This means your contacts in Outlook 2016 won't show up in Skype; you'll need to add your contacts to Skype.
    
    We recommend starting with the Skype app to see if it meets your needs. If it doesn't, then consider the next option, to upgrade your plan.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: You have to set a toggle to allow your employees to use Skype for Business to search for Skype users. See [Let Skype for Business users add Skype contacts](let-skype-for-business-users-add-skype-contacts.md).
    
  
- **Option 2. Upgrade your plan, and buy Cloud PBX and the PSTN Calling plan**.
    
1.  [Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/73318661-8f33-478b-bcc7-fb8d69dbb22a%28Office.14%29.aspx). If you switch to the E3 plan, you also get voicemail.
    
  
2. Buy the Cloud PBX add-on.
    
  
3. Buy a  [PSTN Calling plans for Skype for Business](pstn-calling-plans-for-skype-for-business.md): you can only buy this after you buy the Cloud PBX add-on.
    
  

    This second option is ideal for businesses with several people who make and receive external phone calls.
    
  

## Which add-on licenses do I need to buy to get more features?
<a name="bkmk_whichaddons"> </a>

With add-on licenses you have a lot of options, which can be really confusing.  [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b%28Office.14%29.aspx) and we'll walk you through the options.

The E3 plan is part of your Action Pack. To buy the Cloud PBX and PSTN conferencing add-ons:
  
    
    

1. Buy one seat of E3 from our  [marketing web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=24393). Choose the option to add the seat to your existing tenant.

## Why don't I see the option to buy add-ons?
<a name="bkmk_how"> </a>

In a few situations, you won't see the option to buy Skype for Business add-ons in the Office 365 admin center.
  
    
    

- **You purchased Office 365 Business Premium through GoDaddy**. In this case, you can't buy Skype for Business add-ons. You need to switch to the E3 plan (which GoDaddy doesn't sell) and then you can buy them. [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b%28Office.14%29.aspx#bkmk_call_support).
    
  
- **You have a monthly commitment instead of an annual commitment**. In some cases, customers who have a monthly commitment cannot buy the add-ons (this is different from the payment method, which can be monthly). This is a known issue that we are fixing.

## How to sign up for PSTN Consumption billing
<a name="bkmk_billing"> </a>

Before you can sign up for PSTN Consumption billing, you need the following add-ons as minimum prerequisites:
  
    
    

- Cloud PBX and the PSTN Calling Plan
    
  
- Or, PSTN Conferencing
    
  
Once you have those, here's how you sign up:
  
    
    

1. Sign in to the Office 365 admin center.
    
  
2. Go to **Billing** > **Subscriptions** > **Skype for Business PSTN Consumption**.
    
    
  
    
    
![Choose Skype for Business PSTN Consumption to add funds.](images/878ae28f-b940-469f-93b1-f86f51f8244d.png)
  
    
    

  
    
    

  
    
    

    
  
3. Choose **Add funds**. We strongly recommend setting up **auto-charge** so you don't run out of funds, which will block your users from making calls.
    
  
4. After you sign up for PSTN Consumption billing, you'll need to assign a PSTN Consumption billing license to each user in your business who makes calls. You'll have an unlimited number of licenses available.
