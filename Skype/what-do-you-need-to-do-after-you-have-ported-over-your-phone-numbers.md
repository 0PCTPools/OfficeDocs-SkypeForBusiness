# What do you need to do after you have ported over your phone numbers?

After you have submitted your port order, we will contact your carrier and working out the details with them. When the final transfer date has been set, we will notify you via email. However, while waiting on your carrier to accept the order, go ahead and create the required emergency address you will use with these numbers.
