# See a list of dial-in conferencing dial-in numbers

When you set up dial-in conferencing in Skype for Business Online, you can view the phone numbers that are available for dial-in conferencing for your users. This list will have all of the dial-in conferencing phone numbers that are available to your organization. If you are looking for all of the phone numbers available for dial-in conferencing, we don't list each phone, but you can see to see  [Phone numbers for dial-in conferencing](phone-numbers-for-dial-in-conferencing.md) the countries/regions that have dial-in conferencing numbers.
  
    
    

If there is only one phone number available in your organization, it will be used as the default number for all of your users. When multiple phone numbers are available, you can select the default phone number for each user. This default number will be included in Skype for Business Online meeting invitations.
You can see  [Set the dial-in phone numbers for meeting organizers that are included on invites](set-the-dial-in-phone-numbers-for-meeting-organizers-that-are-included-on-invite.md) to change the dial-in phone number for a single user.
  
    
    


> [!NOTE]
> Domestic dial-in numbers are dedicated to your organization and are the only ones that can be set as a default phone number. However, international dial-in numbers may be shared across multiple organizations. 
  
    
    


## To view your dial-in conferencing phone numbers


1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
  
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
  
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation go to **Dial-in conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge**, then:
    
  - You can view the phone numbers that are available for dial-in conferencing. 
    
  
  - You can also view the location, and the primary and secondary languages that will be used by the dial-in conferencing auto attendant.
    
  

> [!NOTE]
