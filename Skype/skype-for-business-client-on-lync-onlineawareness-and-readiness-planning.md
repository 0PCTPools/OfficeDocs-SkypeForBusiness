# Skype for Business client on Lync Online - Awareness and readiness planning

The Skype for Business client is inspired by the look and feel of Skype but provides the same level of security and control of the Lync client. This new user interface is an update to the existing Lync 2013 client that will be available in a monthly update for those customers with Office 2013 Pro Plus.
  
    
    

When the Skype for Business client is launched it is critical to cover two key elements for successful transition and adoption of the new user interface - awareness and readiness. The largest part of this transition is bringing awareness that the new client experience will be installed on the users' desktops and to provide a number of readiness resources to help you in transitioning smoothly to the new Skype for Business. For a bit more information about the client, see  [Lync Online is becoming Skype for Business ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528320).
As we approach the release of Skype for Business, we will continue to add additional resources to help with getting your organization ready for the transition.
  
    
    

Here are some things to consider how you will develop your rollout and adoption plan. Here are a few questions you may want to ask:
- Are we relying on Office 365 to deliver updates to my organization?
    
  
- How long will it take to prepare your technical help desk people to assist users?
    
  
- Do you need to update internal sites or resources to help users?
    
  

## Suggested communication plans for your organization

It is important that you prepare users in your organization for **Lync becoming Skype for Business**. You will see this change with the April release of the Office Update starting 4/14/2015.
  
    
    

- Two weeks prior (around 3/30/2015) to the release of the new Skype for Business client, send an email to your users that **Lync is changing to Skype for Business**.
    
  
- Five days prior ( around 4/9/2015) to when you roll out the new Skype for Business client, send an email to your users that **Lync is changing to Skype for Business**.
    
  
- When the new Skype for Business client is released on 4/14/2015, send an email to your users that the new **Skype for Business client is released** and they will start seeing changes over the next two weeks.
    
  

## Resources for adoption of the new client

To help you with user adoption, here are some resources that we will provide:
  
    
    

- This is what we call our "First Run Experience". This contains resources that include a quick intro to the new Skype for Business user interface and the features that run on the first client install for a user. 
    
  
- There are end-user videos. These videos will contain an introduction and a What's New video to help users on what to expect from these changes.
    
  
- There will be email templates that you will get. These will be sample emails that you can use to provide to users in your organization and let them know that changes are coming.
