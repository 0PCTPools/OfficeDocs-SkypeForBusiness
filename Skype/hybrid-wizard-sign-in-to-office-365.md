## Sign in to Office 365

Enter the user name and password for your Office 365 tenant to login and connect your on-premises deployment with your Office 365 tenant. You'll need to use the admin account that was created for the onmicrosoft domain when you signed up for Office 365, for example, admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com.
