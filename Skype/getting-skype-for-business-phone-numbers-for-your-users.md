# Getting Skype for Business phone numbers for your users

Before you can set up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must use the Skype for Business admin center to get your phone numbers.
  
    
    

You have two ways of getting numbers for your users:
- Get new numbers using the Skype for Business admin center.
    
  
- Port or transfer your existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier.
    
  
You must use the **New numbers** page to see, search, acquire, and reserve those numbers. You can search by **Country/Region** **State** and **City** and then enter the number of phone numbers you will need for your users.
