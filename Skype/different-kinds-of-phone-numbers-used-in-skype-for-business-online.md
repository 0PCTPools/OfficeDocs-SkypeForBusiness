# Different kinds of phone numbers used in Skype for Business Online

Skype for Business Online uses different kind of telephone numbers depending on what you want to do with the number. Skype for Business Online uses **subscriber** numbers which can be assigned to users in your organization and **service** numbers which are assigned to services such as PSTN Conferencing, auto attendants or call queues. Service phone numbers have a *higher concurrent call capacity*  than subscriber (or user) numbers. Service phone number which are available will vary by country/region and the type of number (whether it's a toll or toll-free number). If you need additional or other number types other than those numbers seen in the Skype for Business administration center, you may submit a phone number request to the Microsoft telephone number service desk.

  - **Geographic numbers** Geographic numbers have a relationship to a geographic area and are the most common. For example, geographic telephone numbers in most cases can only be used within a certain address, city, state or region of the country.
    
  
  - **﻿Non-Geographic numbers** Non-geographic numbers are national numbers which don't have a relationship to a geographic area within a country/region. For example, non-geographic numbers often have the same cost when calling the number from anywhere within the country/region﻿. Also, some countries like Denmark that only have non-geographic numbers available.
