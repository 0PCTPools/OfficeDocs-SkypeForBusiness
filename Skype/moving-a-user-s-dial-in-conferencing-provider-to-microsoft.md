# Moving a user's dial-in conferencing provider to Microsoft


  
    
    

To use Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing, users in your organization need to have PSTN Conferencing licenses assigned to them and their dial-in conferencing provider should be set to Microsoft. See,  [Try or purchase PSTN conferencing](try-or-purchase-pstn-conferencing.md) to get more information on licensing and how much they cost.
## To a move a user's dial-in conferencing provider to Microsoft

If a PSTN Conferencing license is assigned to a user that doesn't have a dial-in conferencing provider, the user's provider will be automatically set to Microsoft and you don't have to do anything else. If the user already had a dial-in conferencing provider, you must change the user's provider to Microsoft after assigning them a **Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing** license
  
    
    
To set Microsoft as the dial-in conferencing provider for a user that has a **Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing** license assigned but is using another dial-in conferencing provider do this:
  
    
    

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
  
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
  
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, go to **Dial-in conferencing**.
    
  
4. If you see a banner that is notifying you that there are users with a **Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing** license assigned but don't have Microsoft set as their dial-in conferencing provider yet, click **Click here to move them**. If you don't see the banner, in the **Skype for Business admin center** click **Dial-in users** and select the **Users ready to be moved to Microsoft PSTN Conferencing** filter.
    
  
5. Select the users that you want to move and then in the action pane, click **Edit**.
    
  
6. Select **Microsoft** in the **Provider name** list.
    
    > [!NOTE]
      > When the dial-in conferencing provider of a user is changed to Microsoft, the dial-in conferencing information of the user will change. If you need to keep this information, please record it somewhere before changing the provider of any of the users. 
7. Click **Save**. 
    
  

## What else should I know?


- If you select the user in the list, you can view the default dial-in conferencing information of the user but you won't be able to see the dial-in conferencing PIN. You can reset the dial-in conferencing PIN of a user by clicking **Reset**.
    
  
- If you want to change dial-in conferencing settings for a user, you can select the user from the list and then click **Edit** and make your changes on the **Properties** page.
