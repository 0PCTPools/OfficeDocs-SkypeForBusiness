# SQL Server Reporting Services (Groups)
[]
In the **Specify Read-Only Group**, specify the group to whom you want to grant read-only access to Monitoring reports. Use the format <domain>\\<access group>. For example: contoso\\RTCUniversalReadOnlyAdmins.
  
    
    

Assigning a group read-only access is optional. If you do not want to grant read-only access now, you can configure it later directly in SQL Server Reporting Services.
