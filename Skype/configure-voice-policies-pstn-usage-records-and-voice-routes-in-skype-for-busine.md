# Configure voice policies, PSTN usage records, and voice routes in Skype for Business 2015
[] **Summary:** Learn how to configure voice policies, PSTN usage records, and voice routes in Skype for Business Server 2015.
Voice policies, PSTN usage records, and voice routes are integrally related. You configure voice policies by selecting a set of calling features and then assigning the policy a set of PSTN usage records, which specify what rights are authorized for the users or groups who are assigned the voice policy. Voice routes are also assigned PSTN usage records, which serve to match routes with the users who are authorized to use them. That is, users can only place calls that use the routes for which they have a matching PSTN usage record.
  
    
    

The recommended workflow for a new Enterprise Voice deployment is to start by configuring a voice policy that includes the appropriate PSTN usage records, and then associate the appropriate routes to each PSTN usage record. 
> [!NOTE]
> You can also create voice policies with  *user*  scope and assign them to individual users or groups.
