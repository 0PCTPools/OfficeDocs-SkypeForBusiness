# Manually submit a custom service request

 If you have service numbers for dial-in conferencing bridges, auto attendants or other service numbers, toll-free phone numbers or have more than 999 user (subscriber) phone numbers that you need to transfer to Skype for Business, you need to manually submit a port order.
  
    
    


> [!IMPORTANT]
> In some countries/regions, you will also need to manually submit a custom service request if you want to get telephone numbers, or release the numbers, or change addresses. To see what is required for each country/region or learn more about number porting, see  [Everything you need to know before porting numbers](transfer-phone-numbers-to-skype-for-business-online.md#bk_LNPcountries). 
  
    
    


## Step 1: Fill out the Letter of authorization (LOA)

The  * **Letter of Authorization (LOA)*** gives us permission to request, on your behalf, porting the existing number(s) from a different service provider in case of a dispute.
  
    
    
When you are porting service numbers, toll-free phone numbers or have more than 999 user (subscriber) phone numbers, you must complete and attach the LOA form to service request you create in Step 2. You can download the LOA from  [Download a Letter of Authorization (LOA)](download-a-letter-of-authorization-loa.md).
  
    
    
 **IMPORTANT**:
  
    
    

- There are separate letter of authorizations (LOA) that you must download but this depends on the country/region and the types of phone number you will be transferring. For each type of LOA, go  [Download a Letter of Authorization (LOA)](download-a-letter-of-authorization-loa.md).
    
  
- When you manually port phone numbers using a Letter of Authorization (LOA), make sure you download the **correct version for the country** and ** type of phone number** you want to transfer.
    
  
- You have to **submit separate port orders** for each type of phone number you want to transfer. For more information and for a list of types, see [Transfer phone numbers to Skype for Business Online](transfer-phone-numbers-to-skype-for-business-online.md)
