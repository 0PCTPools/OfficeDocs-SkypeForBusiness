# Compare dial-in conferencing providers

When you set up dial-in or PSTN conferencing for Skype for Business, you need to choose a dial-in conferencing provider. You can choose either Microsoft as your dial-in conferencing provider, or a third party. 
  
    
    

Whether Microsoft is the dial-in conferencing provider, or a third-party providers this service, in both cases they will do the following: 
- Provide a  *dial-in conferencing bridge*  . The conferencing bridge will set dial-in phone numbers, PINs and conference IDs for meetings.
    
  
- Give toll, toll-free and international phone numbers that users will dial into. The phone numbers are then included in the meeting invite.
    
  
- Set the language that users will hear when they dial into a meeting.
    
  
- Create meeting conference IDs that are used when users are joining a meeting.
    
  
- Give you organizer PINs to start meetings over the phone.
    
  
Use the following table to compare what you get if you choose Microsoft or a third-party dial-in conferencing provider.
