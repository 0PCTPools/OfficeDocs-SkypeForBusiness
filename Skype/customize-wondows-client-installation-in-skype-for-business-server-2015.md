# Customize Wondows client installation in Skype for Business Server 2015
[]Overview of installation methods and tools.
Detailed information about using and customizing Click-to-Run installation is available in the Office 365 Resource Kit documentation (see the" [Overview of Click-to-Run customization](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219428%28v=office.15%29)"). Administrators can also download the Office 365 Click-to-Run program and language source files to an on-premises location, which is useful when you want to minimize the demand on the network or prevent users from installing software from the Internet because of corporate security requirements.
  
    
    

Enterprise administrators can customize the Office 365 Windows Installer-based (.msi) installation by using the methods discussed in this section. Because no single tool provides all customization options, you'll likely use a combination of these methods in your Skype for Business deployment. You might use the tools described in the following sections:
-  [Use the Office Customization Tool (OCT) in Skype for Business Server 2015](use-the-office-customization-tool-oct-in-skype-for-business-server-2015.md) to customize setup options and features for Skype for Business and other Office programs.
    
  
-  [Use Config.xml to perform installation tasks in Skype for Business Server 2015](use-config-xml-to-perform-installation-tasks-in-skype-for-business-server-2015.md) to specify the path of the network installation point and perform silent installation.
    
  
-  [Use Setup command-line options in Skype for Business Server 2015](use-setup-command-line-options-in-skype-for-business-server-2015.md) to specify the Config.xml file to use during installation.
    
  
-  [Configure client bootstrapping policies in Skype for Business Server 2015](configure-client-bootstrapping-policies-in-skype-for-business-server-2015.md) by using the Group Policy Object Editor MMC snap-in.
    
  
There will probably be other options you'll want to configure as you deploy the Office suite of products. The topics in this section give an overview of these customization tools and discuss considerations specific to Skype for Business. Included are links to detailed Office help for each tool.
