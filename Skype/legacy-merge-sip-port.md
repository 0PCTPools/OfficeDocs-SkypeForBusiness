# Legacy Merge SIP Port
[]
The default Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SIP port for communicating with clients, legacy Front End pools, and servers is 5061. If the default value was not used, select **SIP port for all pools and servers:** and enter the new value.
  
    
    

If your legacy deployment is configured for Automatic Client sign-in, select **Automatic discovery of SIP port configuration for each pool** and click **Next** to continue.
