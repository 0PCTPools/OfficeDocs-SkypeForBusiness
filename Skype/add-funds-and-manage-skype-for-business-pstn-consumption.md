# Add funds and manage Skype for Business PSTN Consumption

Skype for Business PSTN Consumption is a convenient way to pay for Skype for Business PSTN services. It helps ensure you and your users are never caught without being able to:
  
    
    


- Dial in to PSTN conferencing meetings using toll-free dial-in phone numbers.
    
  
- Dialing out from a PSTN conferencing meeting to add someone else from anywhere in the world.
    
  
- Dialing out from a PSTN conference to your mobile phone with the Skype for Business app installed.
    
  
- Dial any international phone number when you have PSTN domestic calling subscriptions.
    
  

> [!NOTE]
> If you're wondering how much it is and the rates, see  [PSTN Consumption Rate Table](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=799523). 
  
    
    

As admin, you can add funds manually or you can set up auto-recharge which we **recommend**.Auto-recharge automatically tops off your balance when it falls below the trigger amount you set. We recommend using auto-recharge so you don't have to remember to add funds manually. When your balance hits the trigger amount, funds are added automatically. If you don't choose auto-recharge, you run the risk of your balance falling below zero. At that point, you and your users won't be able to make toll-free calls or international calls.You can update your payment options at any time. On the **Subscriptions** page, select **Skype for Business PSTN Consumption**, and make your updates. Funds will be applied only to Skype for Business PSTN Consumption services at Microsoft's published rates when the services are used. Any funds not used within 12 months of the purchase date will expire and be forfeited.
> [!TIP]
> We'll send you email notifications when funds are added via auto-recharge, when auto-recharge fails, for example, when a credit card expires, and when your balance falls below zero.
