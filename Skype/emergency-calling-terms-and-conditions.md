# Emergency calling terms and conditions


  
    
    


## IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Emergency Services calling operates differently with Skype for Business PSTN Calling services than on traditional telephone services. It is important that you understand these differences and communicate them to all users of the Skype for Business PSTN Calling service. You acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the differences in our Emergency Services calling and will provide this notice to each user of Skype for Business PSTN Calling services.
  
    
    
The differences in our Emergency Services calling capabilities include the following: (i) Skype for Business may not know the actual location of a caller making an Emergency Services call, which could result in the call being routed to the wrong Emergency Services call center and/or emergency services being dispatched to the wrong location; ((ii) if the user's device has no power, is experiencing a power outage or, for any reason, cannot otherwise access the Internet, the user cannot make an Emergency Services call through Skype for Business PSTN Calling services; and (iii) although Skype for Business PSTN Calling services can be used anywhere in the world where an Internet connection is available, users should not make an Emergency Services call from a location outside their home country/region because the call likely will not be routed to the appropriate call center in that country/region.
