# Assign or change an emergency address for a user

When you are setting up PSTN calling, you will need to assign a phone number and emergency address to each of your users. The emergency address must be created before you can associate it with a phone number. See,  [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md)
