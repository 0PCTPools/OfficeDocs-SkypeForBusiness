[]
Skype for Business Server 2015 web conferencing includes document collaboration, application sharing, and desktop sharing.
  
    
    


> [!NOTE]
> Skype for Business Server 2015 uses Office Web Apps and the Office Web Apps Server to handle sharing and rendering of PowerPoint presentations. Web conferencing features function exactly the same as they do in Microsoft Lync 2013. For details about installing and configuring the Office Web Apps Server, see  [Configuring integration with Office Web Apps Server and Lync Server 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj204792%28v=ocs.15%29.aspx).
