# Add, change or remove an emergency location for your organization

 Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization you can create emergency locations for buildings, floors, and offices to create a more specific emergency address. See, [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md).
