# Change the emergency address for a user

When you are setting up PSTN calling, you will need to assign an emergency address to each phone number or user. In European countries, the emergency address is associated to the phone number when it is you get it from Office 365 or when you transfer a phone number over to Office 365. In the US, the emergency address is associated to the phone number when it is assigned to the user. The emergency address can be changed if the user it is assigned to moves to a new location. For more about emergency addresses and locations, see  [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md) for details.
