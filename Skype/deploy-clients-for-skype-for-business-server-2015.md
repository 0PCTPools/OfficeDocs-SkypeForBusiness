[]Overview of enterprise client installation methods.

It provides a faster installation, so users can be up and running Office in a matter of minutes. If you have ten minutes to spare, you can find out more about Click-to-Run in a video that is part of our Garage series. . [Watch the video "Who moved my MSI?"](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office_resource_kit/2013/03/05/the-new-office-garage-series-who-moved-my-msi/).

Detailed information about using and customizing Click-to-Run installation is available in the Office 365 Resource Kit documentation. Administrators can also download the Office 365 Click-to-Run program and language source files to an on-premises location, which is useful when you want to minimize the demand on the network or prevent users from installing software from the Internet because of corporate security requirements.

     Other benefits of using C2R technology includes having the ability to control bandwidth used to download updates by using Background Intelligence Transfer Services (BITS) when downloading updates. BITS uses idle network bandwidth to transfer files and can increase or decrease the rate at which files are transferred based on the amount of idle network bandwidth is available. As a global admin you also have the ability to deactivate an installation.
    
    Detailed information about using and customizing Click-to-Run installation is available in the Office 365 Resource Kit documentation (see the" [Overview of Click-to-Run customization](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219428%28v=office.15%29)"). Administrators can also download the Office 365 Click-to-Run program and language source files to an on-premises location, which is useful when you want to minimize the demand on the network or prevent users from installing software from the Internet because of corporate security requirements.
    
  
- **MSI Windows Installer** is a Windows Installer-based installation package that consists of multiple MSI files. A language-neutral core MSI package is combined with one or more language-specific packages to make a complete product. Setup assembles the individual packages and performs customization and maintenance tasks during and after installation of Office on users' computers. The topics in this section describe how to use and customize the Windows Installer to deploy the Skype for Business client to your users through your normal procedures.
    
  

 You should use the Office documentation in conjunction with topics in this section, which point out deployment considerations that are specific to Skype for Business.
