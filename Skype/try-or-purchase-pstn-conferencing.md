# Try or purchase PSTN conferencing

Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call into a meeting. Skype for Business includes the dial-in conferencing feature for just this situation! People can call into Skype for Business meetings using a phone, instead of using the Skype for Business app on a mobile device or PC. 
  
    
    

You only need to set up dial-in conferencing (also called **PSTN conferencing** ) for people who plan to schedule or lead meetings. Meeting attendees who dial-in don't need any licenses assigned to them or other setup.
## Step 1: Buy and assign PSTN Conferencing licenses

You must be an  [About Office 365 admin roles](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d%28Office.14%29.aspx) to perform this step.
  
    
    

1. Find out if dial-in or PSTN conferencing available in your country.  [Countries and regions that are supported for Skype for Business Online PSTN Services](countries-and-regions-that-are-supported-for-skype-for-business-online-pstn-serv.md). 
    
  
2. Get your PSTN conferencing licenses. If you want to:
    
  - **Try it** before you buy it, you can sign up for an Office 365 Enterprise E5 free trial that includes PSTN conferencing. See [Office 365 Enterprise E5 Trial](https://portal.office.com/Signup?OfferId=101bde18-5ffb-4d79-a47b-f5b2c62525b3).
    
  
  - **Buy it**, see [Skype for Business add-on licensing](skype-for-business-add-on-licensing.md)
    
  
3.  [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc%28Office.14%29.aspx) you purchased to the people in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings.
    
  
4. If you purchased dial-in conferencing add-on licenses and PSTN Consumption billing licenses, assign them, too. For instructions, see  [Assign Skype for Business licenses](assign-skype-for-business-licenses.md).
    
  

## Step 2: Set the dial-in conferencing provider for people who lead or schedule meetings

When you assign a PSTN Conferencing license to people in your organization who lead or schedule meetings, they are all set up and ready to go! (You don't have to set their dial-in conferencing provider.) But if you have users that have been using a third-party audio conferencing provider (ACP), you will need to  [Moving a user's dial-in conferencing provider to Microsoft](moving-a-user-s-dial-in-conferencing-provider-to-microsoft.md).
  
    
    

## Step 3: Other admin tasks

The following steps are **optional**, but a lot of admins like to do them:
  
    
    

1.  [Customize meeting invitations](customize-meeting-invitations.md) . The dial-in numbers that are set for the user will be automatically added to the meeting invitations that are sent to attendees. However, you can add your own help and legal links, a text message, and small company graphic.
    
  
2.  [Set the dial-in phone numbers for meeting organizers that are included on invites](set-the-dial-in-phone-numbers-for-meeting-organizers-that-are-included-on-invite.md) . This is the phone number that will show up in the meeting that is scheduled by the user.
    
  
3.  [Set auto attendant languages for a dial-in conferencing](set-auto-attendant-languages-for-a-dial-in-conferencing.md) that the dial-in conferencing auto-attendant uses to greet a caller when they dial into a dial-in conferencing phone number. This step only applies if you're using Microsoft as your dial-in provider.
    
  
4.  [Set the length of the PIN for dial-in meetings](set-the-length-of-the-pin-for-dial-in-meetings.md) .
