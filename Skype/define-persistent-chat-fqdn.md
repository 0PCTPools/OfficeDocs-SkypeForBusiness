# Define Persistent Chat FQDN
[]
You create a new Persistent Chat Server or Persistent Chat Server pool using the **Define New Persistent Chat Pool** wizard. Select either a **Multiple computer pool** or a **Single computer pool**. If you select a single computer pool and later need a multiple computer pool, you will need to remove the single computer pool and then define a multiple computer pool.
  
    
    

You must also define a **Pool FQDN** for the Persistent Chat Server or Persistent Chat Server pool. The pool fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for a single computer pool must be the same as the FQDN of the computer that makes up the single server pool. For a multiple computer pool, the FQDN must be the name you choose to represent this multiple computer pool and is defined in DNS by a host A (and AAAA if IPv6 is being used) record.
