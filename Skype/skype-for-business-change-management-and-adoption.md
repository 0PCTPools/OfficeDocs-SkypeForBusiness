# Skype for Business change management and adoption

The Skype for Business client is inspired by the look and feel of Skype but provides the same level of security and control as the Lync client. This new user interface is an update to the existing Lync 2013 client that will be available in the April monthly update for those customers with Office 2013 Pro Plus.
  
    
    

When the Skype for Business client is launched it is critical to cover two key elements for successful transition and adoption of the new user interface - awareness and readiness. The largest part of this transition is bringing awareness that the new client experience will be installed on the users' desktops and to provide a number of readiness resources to help you in transitioning smoothly to the new Skype for Business.
As we approach the release of the Skype for Business client, we will continue to add additional resources to help with getting your organization ready for the transition to new client. Please check back here for changes and those additional resources.
