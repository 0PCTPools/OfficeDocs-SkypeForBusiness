# Synchronize users to the cloud and assign licenses
[]
Before actually moving the user to Office 365, you must first confirm that they are synchronized to the cloud, and assign them a license. To do this, you use the Office 365 Admin Center.
  
    
    


### To confirm that a user is synchronized with Office 365


1. Open the Office 365 Admin Center (https://portal.office.com).
    
  
2. On the left navigation pane, click **Users** and then **Active Users**.
    
  
3. Click **Search for a User**, and type the name of the user.
    
  
4. Confirm that you see the user, and that their status is **Synched with Active Directory**.
    
    If the user is not yet synchronized, the next automatic synchronization should happen within three hours. Or you could force a synchronization sooner- for details, see  [Force Directory Synchronization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/JJ151771.aspx).
    
  

## To assign the license

To assign the license in Office 365, see  [Assign or unassign a Cloud PBX license for a user](https://support.office.com/article/Assign-or-unassign-a-Cloud-PBX-license-for-a-user-36c6d5a6-5ea8-4c44-9f18-fea33d5a847e).
