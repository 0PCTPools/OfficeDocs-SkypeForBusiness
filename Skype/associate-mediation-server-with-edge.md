# Associate Mediation Server With Edge
[]
To define a Mediation Server, specify settings that associate the Mediation Server with a Front End Server and with an Edge Server or pool. To associate the Mediation Server or pool with an Edge Server or Edge Server pool, do the following:
  
    
    


1. From the drop-down list, select the Edge pool or Edge Server to associate with the Mediation Server.
    
  
2. Click **Next** to continue.
    
  

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not yet defined an Edge Server or Edge Server pool in your deployment, the drop-down list will not contain entries. You can click **Next** to continue and edit the settings for the Mediation Server after you have added an Edge Server or pool to your deployment.
