The **Certificate Assignment** page starts the process of assigning a certificate to the requested usages on the role server. Click the **View Certificate Details** to view the certificate. You can select the **General** tab, the **Details** tab, or the **Certification Path** tab. The **General** tab will display basic information about the certificate, such as the issuing certification authority and the status of a private key. The Details tab will display certificate information such as the subject name, subject alternative names, and other details. The **Certification Path** tab will display the certificate "chain of trust" from the certificate through any issuing or intermediate certification authorities (if they are present) to the root certification authority.
