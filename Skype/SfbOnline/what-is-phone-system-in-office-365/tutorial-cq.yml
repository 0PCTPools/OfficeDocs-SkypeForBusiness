    [Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/Teams-overview.md) and [Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-What-is-Skype-for-Business-3a21eca4-434d-41f1-ab06-3d4a268573b7) 
    are both part of Office 365 that provide chat, phone conversations, voicemail, meetings, files, and apps together in one place. They both require 
    [**Phone System**](/MicrosoftTeams/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365) licenses to enable call control and PBX capabilities in the Office 365 cloud. The phone system 
    license is included with the Enterprise E5 license, or it can be added to an Enterprise E3 license. Licensing details are at 
    [Skype for Business add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md). 

    A Phone System license allows you to replace your existing PBX system with a [set of features](/MicrosoftTeams/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system) that include 
    voicemail and call queues, which routes people who call your business to one of your company's call agents, who can then fill customer service requests or put in 
    sales orders. Call queues can be used with either Teams or Skype for Business. You create a call queue for your organization using the Skype for Business admin 
    center. A call queue can either be assigned a phone number or be an option choice for an auto attendant.
    
    If you are asked to set up a call queue, this article provides an illustration of planning and implementing one for a hypothetical business. 
    It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but it is a good starting point. 
  
    ## Before you begin

    We assume you've already done the following: 
    - [Set up Phone System in your organization](/MicrosoftTeams/setting-up-your-phone-system.md) with a [Calling Plan](/MicrosoftTeams/calling-plan-landing-page) 
    to provide phone numbers to your users.
    - [Set up Phone System voicemail](/MicrosoftTeams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail.md) 
    - Reviewed  [What are auto attendants and call queues?](/MicrosoftTeams/answer-auto-attendant-and-call-queue-calls.md) to get a 
    better understanding of the Phone System features that can interact with a call queue.


- title: Assess business needs
  durationInMinutes: 4
  content: |

    Contoso Pizza is a small regional pizza delivery chain with twenty locations, and wants to convert their operation to use a virtual call center. They want 
    their call agents to log in to the Teams Desktop client and take orders using the company's existing order-taking system. They like the idea of being able 
    to expand or contract as needed without having to invest in office space for the call center. 

    The needs assessment might include the following questions:

    ### How many call agents will you assign to the queue? 
    The company has 25 call agents in their existing call center. There are typically 12-20 agents. 

    ### How is their existing system set up, and what changes if any do they want to make? 
    They have an auto attendant system for the company office, and there is an option in the system that routes to ordering, but it only connects one or two calls a day. 
    They have a 1-800 number for placing orders and advertise it heavily. Their legacy call queue service provides a single Auto attendant node in front of the call queue.



    ### Will the call center be active 24 hours a day, or have business hours?
    The queue needs to be in use from 11am to 11:30 pm, seven days a week. 
    
    ## Do they want distinct initial greetings for business hours, after-hours, weekends, holidays, and so on.
    They already know that the call rate outside of their business hours is very low. greetings are optional.

    ### How are the agents compensated?
    The agents are paid on an hourly basis, and their performance is tracked in the ordering system. 

    ### What is the usual size of the call queue in the existing call center?
    Depending on the hour, it can vary from 5 to 30.

  durationInMinutes: 2

    ##	General guidelines
    Before we look at our specific example, let’s look briefly at some more general design guidelines and basics. 
    
    A Phone system call queue has a limited number of options. The main decisions to make for the queue are: 
    
        - whether to assign a number directly to the queue, or to have callers connect to an auto attendant first. Callers are unlikely to realize the difference.
        - Whether to have an initial greeting (if you do connect initially to an auto attendant, it's probably not needed)
        - what hold music to use
        - how to distribute the calls among the available agents

    #### Do:
    1.	Keep the number of calls in queue and call wait time for callers as short as possible.
    2.  Have alternate initial greetings for calls taken outside business hours, or on holidays or weekends when agents won't be available. This will involve putting a single auto attendant in front of the call queue.
    3.  Make the call queue as easy to find as possible when your ordering number connects to an auto attendant first.
    4.  Know your customers and provide hold music that will match their interests, or at least not clash badly with their tastes.
 
    
    #### Don't:
    1.	Pitch other products or upsell while callers are waiting on hold.  
    2.	Make callers wait to talk to an agent.

    > [!Important]
    > The keys \* (Repeat) and \# (Back) are reserved by the system and can't be reassigned. If speech recognition is enabled, pressing \* will correspond with 
    "Repeat" and \# will correspond with the "Back" voice commands.
  

    ## Do a design mockup 
    For implementations centered on a call queue like our example, we'll either have a phone number assigned directly to a call queue, or have the phone number assigned to an auto attendant

    For a more complex initial design,  refer to the Auto Attendants tutorial.

    

    If you have Visio, you could use that to visualize your design. The Visio file containing the diagrams above is available for 
    [download](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SkypeForBusiness/blob/live/Skype/SfbOnline/images/CQ-Pizza-CallCenter.vsdx?raw=true). 

- title: Writing the script 
  durationInMinutes: 3
  content: |
    ### Writing better  scripts 
    Your auto-attendant or call queue outgoing message script can make or break the impression left on your customers or callers. 
    Plan it carefully, write it out, and consider having it professionally recorded. The goal is to connect the caller to a live person as efficiently as possible.
    Think about some of these guidelines when writing the script dialog:

    #### Do:
    1.	Greet and thank the caller for contacting you. Keep this short, no more than three sentences and under 30 seconds. If your web site offers self-service 
    options, mention it but otherwise present choices and options as soon as possible without being abrupt. 
    2.	Use multilingual prompts, but put the secondary language or languages at the end of the first set of options.
    3.	Present the option, then the number to press ("For Sales, press 3"). When the caller hears the option they want, their attention immediately focuses, so 
    that's the time to tell them what will get them there.
    4.	Make sure the voice for the prompts leaves the impression you want and is clearly understandable.  Phone System has a built in text to speech 
    engine which gives you the option of entering your final text and deciding for yourself whether it's conveying the impression you want. If not, 
    recording an audio prompt is fully supported. If the voice mumbles, sounds condescending, or has other issues, keep looking.
    5.	Mention significant changes to your option structure when that happens, but don't leave that part of the greeting active for more than a month. If you 
    have frequent updates and expect that to be the case most of the time, just omit it from the script.
    
    #### Don't:
    1.	Clutter the initial greeting with hours of operation or your business address. Make those available as a choice in the first menu if it's frequently 
    requested information, but keep the initial greeting short and sweet.
    2.	Say please or use other pleasantries over and over. Just get the callers to the option or person they need as efficiently as possible.
    3.	Include "http:\/\/www\." when mentioning a web address. It's just a poor use of script time.
    4.	Use abbreviations like St for street or CA for California. Spell them out in the script and say the whole word in the recording. 
    Text to speech engines don't usually do well with abbreviations.
    5.	Include sales information in the scripts, you'll annoy your callers. Let your sales force take care of that sort of thing.

    And finally, if your company has a slogan, think twice about including it in the script at all. Chances are your callers have heard it before if they're calling 
    you. If you do include it, put it somewhere it brings the Auto Attendant experience to a close, like when transferring to an individual's desk line or voicemail. 
    If you’ve had a slogan or tag line for a long time that many of your customers know, it might or might not be worth including. The "golden rule" here is to connect the caller to a person as efficiently as possible.

    ### Sample greeting scripts

    > [!Important]
    > The keys \* (Repeat) and \# (Back) are reserved by the system and can't be reassigned. If speech recognition is enabled, pressing \* will correspond with 
    "Repeat" and \# will correspond with the "Back" voice commands.

    These scripts reflect the design we chose earlier, and the suggested guidelines for writing Auto Attendant scripts. 

    #### Auto Attendant Script 1: business hours greeting
    Thanks for calling Contoso Pizza. Please stay on the line and the next available agent will take your order.
    
    #### Auto Attendant Script 2: after-hours greeting
    Thanks for calling Contoso Pizza.   We’re closed at this time, please call back between 11am and 11:30pm to order fresh piping hot pizza! 




    #### Script 3: call queue greeting
    Thanks for calling Contoso Pizza. If you're calling between 11am and 11:30pm please stay on the line and the next available agent will take your order. Outside those hourswe are closed, please call back when we are open.

   



- title: Implementing a call queue (with or without Auto Attendants)
  durationInMinutes: 7
  content: |

    The information needed to implement the design in the earlier diagram is presented in the tables that follow.
    The implementation uses text-to-speech for the scripts. Phone System has a built in text to speech engine so you the option 
    of entering your final text and deciding for yourself whether it conveys the impression you want. If not, it's up to you whether to record your 
    own prompts using [Sound Recorder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14090/windows-sound-recorder-app-faq) 
    in Windows or have a professional voice-over artist use your scripts to record .wav files.
    
    As mentioned earlier, your implementation could easily involve Call Queues, which could be used in place of the lawyer, paralegal, and billing 
    Auto Attendants below. A Call Queue would transfer the call to any of the available lawyers, paralegals, or billing clerks. See [Create a Phone System call queue](/MicrosoftTeams/create-a-phone-system-call-queue.md)
    for more about Call Queues. If you choose to do this, you'll need to create a valid Call Queue before creating an Auto Attendant menu that refers to the Call Queue.

    Your account must have Admin priveleges: in the **Microsoft Teams admin center**, click **Legacy Portal** then select **Call routing** > **Auto attendants**, then click **Add new**.
    The following tables show values to enter in the user interface screens. Each table represents a user interface screen.
    
    Create the following Auto Attendants in the following order and set their general information, then once the main and nested Auto Attendants are all created, edit them to set the 
    Business hours call handling. A nested Auto Attendant needs to already exist when you link to it in another Auto Attendant's menu choices. 

    - Main (VanArsdel, Ltd.)
      - 
    
    


    ### Ordering Auto Attendant (Optional)

    ![New Auto Attendant page 1.](../images/edacec94-9384-4a87-be0a-5c49a151287e.png)

    **Edit general info** for the main menu

    |   Option   | Setting      |
    |:---  |:---   |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png) Name  |   Contoso Pizza   | 	
    | ![Number 2](../images/sfbcallout2.png) Phone Number	|555-0170  |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png) Time Zone	| (UTC-04:00) Eastern Daylight Time (US & Canada) |
    | ![Number 4](../images/sfbcallout4.png) Language	| English (United States)  |
    | ![Number 5](../images/sfbcallout5.png) Speech Recognition	| Enabled |
    |  |  | 
     
    Only the main menu, named *Contoso Pizza* needs an assigned Phone Number or a Company Greeting.  
    


    ![New Auto Attendant Hours of operation.](../images/61769547-cdb4-45c0-af5a-3d6e0731fbc6.png)

    **Select hours of operation** for the main menu

    |   Option   | Setting      |
    |:--- | :--- |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png) 24/7-Custom| Custom  |
    | ![Number 2](../images/sfbcallout2.png) Selection|  11:00am to 11:30pm, Monday-Sunday  |
    
    The default for this screen is 24/7. 

    ![Business hours call handling.](../images/2a33b1f7-d362-47a7-bf32-ef702bc878e8.png)

    **Business hours call handling** for the main menu

    |   Option   | Setting      |
    |:---  |:---  |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png) Company greeting	| Create a custom greeting > Callers will hear: Copy/paste Script 1 above  |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png) What happens to the calls after the greeting?	| Redirect call  to  |
    | ![Number 4](../images/sfbcallout4.png) Dial By Name  | Enabled   |
    | ![Number 5](../images/sfbcallout5.png) Edit Menu options	|**1:** Enter the Name of the option: Scheduling <br/>Send to: Person in your company: **Julie Wolfe** <br/>**2:** Enter the Name of the option: Billing <br/>Send to: nested Auto Attendant **Billing** <br/>**3:** Enter the name of the option: Hours <br/>Send to: nested Auto Attendant **Hours&Location** |
    |  |   |
    
    The Company Greeting usually only needs to be set on the main menu, with a nested Auto Attendant we want to flow straight through to the Custom Prompt.


    **After hours call handling** for the main menu
    The After Hours call handling screen is very similar to the Business hours Call handling screen.
    
    |   Option   | Setting|
    |:---  | :---  |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png) Company greeting	| Create a custom greeting, callers will hear: Copy/paste Script 2 above |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png) What happens to the calls after the greeting?|	Redirect call- Send to: Person in your company: **Julie Wolfe**. <br/> The call will go to voicemail when not picked up.  |
    |  |   |

    While setting up your after hours call handling for the Main Auto Attendant, you could choose to create the same menu options used in the business hours call handling screen. Doing this would allow the after 
    hours callers to navigate the same menus as business hours callers. It's a matter of preference which approach you choose.

    Set up **holidays** and the **dial scope** as you see fit, and save the Main Auto Attendant.

    ### Nested Auto Attendants

    Nested Auto Attendants don't usually have phone numbers associated or a company greeting, and they only get accessed as directed in the main Auto Attendant.

    Set up the General Information for the nested Auto Attendants using different names but the same Time Zone, Language, Speech Recognition and Operator settings. 
    
    Set the business hours call handling as shown for each Auto Attendant. You can leave the business hours for a nested Auto Attendant set to the default, 24/7.
    
    You can also choose to leave the holidays and dial scope settings at their defaults for nested Auto Attendants.
    
    
    **Nested Auto Attendant: Billing (nested under main menu)**

    Business hours call handling settings for this Auto Attendant:
    
    |   Option   | Setting|

    See the step-by-step implementation details for Phone System Auto Attendants at [Creating an Auto Attendant](/MicrosoftTeams/set-up-a-phone-system-auto-attendant.md) for more detail on the options available in these screens. 


    ### Editing and testing Auto Attendants

    After you have saved your Auto Attendant, it will be listed on the **Auto Attendants** page of the Admin center. 
    This will allow you to quickly see some of the options that you have set up.
    
    The best way to test the implementation is to call the number configured for an Auto Attendant and choose options to navigate to each of the auto 
    attendants you've just created. You can also quickly place a test call to your Auto Attendant by using the **Test button** in the Action pane. 
    If you want to make changes to an Auto Attendant, select the Auto Attendant, and then in the Action pane click **Edit**.
