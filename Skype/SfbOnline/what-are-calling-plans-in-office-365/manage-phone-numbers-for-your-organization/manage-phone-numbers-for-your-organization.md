## Transferring numbers with Letters of Authorization (LOAs)

A **Letter of Authorization (LOA)** gives us permission to request, on your behalf, transferring the existing number(s) from a different service provider in case of a dispute. Use an LOA if you have service numbers for audio conferencing bridges, auto attendants, or other service numbers, toll-free phone numbers, or have more than 999 user (subscriber) phone numbers that you need to transfer to Skype for Business (or if you don't want to use the **Local Number Porting wizard**). You must [Manually submit a custom service request](manually-submit-a-custom-service-request.md) with the LOA to get phone numbers transferred from your current service provider.

Select your country below to find the LOA form you need.
