# Manage phone numbers for your organization

## Request forms for new phone numbers

Each country or region has different instructions for getting phone numbers in Skype for Business Online and Microsoft Teams. Sometimes (depending on your country/region) you won't be able to get new user (subscriber) numbers or service numbers using the **Skype for Business admin center**, or you might need specific phone numbers or area codes. If so, you will need to download a form and send it back to us. Our service desk will take it from there and let you know about progress or your order. 

Choose your country or region from the [list below](#select-your-country-or-region-to-find-the-downloadable-forms-you-need) to find the form you need. 

## Letters of Authorization (LOAs) for transferring numbers
If you need to transfer phone numbers, you'll to download a **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**, which gives us permission to request, on your behalf, transferring the existing number(s) from a different service provider in case of a dispute. Use an LOA if you have service numbers for audio conferencing bridges, auto attendants, or other service numbers, toll-free phone numbers, or have more than 999 user (subscriber) phone numbers that you need to transfer to Skype for Business (or if you don't want to use the **Local Number Porting wizard**). You must [manually submit a custom service request](../../what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/manually-submit-a-custom-service-request.md) with the LOA to get phone numbers transferred from your current service provider.

Choose your country or region from the list below to find the LOA you need.
