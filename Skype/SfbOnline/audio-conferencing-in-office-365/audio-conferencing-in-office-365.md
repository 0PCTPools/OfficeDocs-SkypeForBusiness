# Audio Conferencing in Office 365

## What is Audio Conferencing?

Calling in to meetings is very useful when people are on the road, for example, and can't attend a meeting using the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app on their laptop or mobile devices. But there are other scenarios in which using a phone to attend a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meeting can be a better option than using an app on a computer:
  
- Internet connectivity is limited.
- A meeting is audio only.
- The person tried to join a Skype for Business meeting and it failed.
- The call quality is better if they dial in.
- People can join a meeting "hands free" using Bluetooth devices.
- People find it's easier and more convenient for their situation.

You only need to set up Audio Conferencing for people who plan to schedule or lead meetings. Meeting attendees who dial in don't need any licenses assigned to them or other setup.

## Find out where Audio Conferencing is available?
With Audio Conferencing, there are toll and toll free phone numbers that can be used by your users to dial-in to meetings. Toll (service) numbers from the following countries or regions are automatically assigned as shared audio conferencing numbers to organizations when they're enabled for Audio Conferencing. Dedicated toll and toll-free numbers can be assigned to your organization from additional cities.

Toll-free phone numbers (service numbers) are available but only in some countries/regions. To see a list of the numbers that are available, go [here](../../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-r
egion-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

After you have decided you want Audio Conferencing for your organization, you need to buy 1 **Audio Conferencing** license for each person in your organization who is going to schedule/host an audio meeting.

## How do conferencing bridges work?

When you are setting up audio conferencing in for Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams, you will get an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers. The phone number you set will be included on the meeting invites for Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams apps.
  
The audio conferencing bridge answers a call for people who are dialing in to a meeting using a phone. It answers the caller with voice prompts from an auto attendant and then, depending on your settings, can play notifications and ask callers to record their name. **Microsoft bridge settings** allow you to change the settings for meeting notifications and the meeting join experience, and set the length of the PINs that are used by meeting organizers. Meeting organizers use PINs to start meetings if they can't join the meeting using the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app.

## How do you get phone numbers?
There are three ways to get numbers for you conferencing bridges:

- **Use the Skype for Business admin center.** For some countries/regions, you can get numbers for your conference bridges using the Skype for Business admin center, see [Getting phone numbers for .](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/getting-service-phone-numbers.md).
    
- **Port your existing numbers.** You can port or transfer existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier to Office 365. See [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365.md) or [Manage phone numbers for your organization](manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md) for more information to help you do this.  
  
- **Use a request form for new numbers.** Sometimes (depending on your country/region) you won't be able to get your new phone numbers using the Skype for Business admin center, or you will need specific phone numbers or area codes. If so, you will need to download a form and send it back to us. See [Manage phone numbers for your organization](manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md) for more information.
