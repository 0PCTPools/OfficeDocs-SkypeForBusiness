# Pending Certificate (Returned)
 
The **Online Certificate Request Status** page returns the current status of the certificate. If the certificate is still in a pending approval state with the certification authority administrator—that is, if it has not yet been approved—the status will indicate that the certificate is still being processed.
  
If the pending request has been approved and the retrieval of the certificate is successful, the status will indicate that a certificate has been assigned to the local certificate store, and the status pane will also display the certificate thumbprint.
  
If the certification authority administrator denies the certificate request, the status pane will report that the request of the pending certificate with a given ID (maintained by the certification authority) is denied.
  
Click **Finish** to complete the pending certificate processing.
