# Configure user access for federation with a Skype for Business Online customer in Skype for Business Server


You must configure the user accounts of all the users in your organization in order for them be allowed to communicate with federated partners. This configuration is applied for all federated partners, including any Microsoft Skype for Business Online customer domains with which you support federation. For details about configuring federation support for user accounts, see [Configure policies to control federated user access](../external-access-policies/configure-policies-to-control-federated-user-access.md) and [Assign an external user access policy to a Skype for Business enabled user](../external-access-policies/assign-an-external-user-access-policy.md).
