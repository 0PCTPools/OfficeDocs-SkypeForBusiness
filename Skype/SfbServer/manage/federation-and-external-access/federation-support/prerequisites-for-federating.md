# Prerequisites for federating with a Skype for Business Online customer in Skype for Business Server

To federate with a Skype for Business Online customer, you should have already completed initial deployment and configuration of Skype for Business Server in your organization. This includes the following:

  - Deploying at least one Standard Edition server or one Enterprise Edition Front End pool in your organization. 

  - Enabling internal user accounts for Skype for Business Server. 

  - Deploying at least one Edge Server and the other components required to support external user access. For details, see [Managing federation and external access to Skype for Business Server](../managing-federation-and-external-access.md).

  - Enabling federation support within your organization and configuring the appropriate method for controlling access by federated domains. For details, see [Enable or disable remote user access](../access-edge/enable-or-disable-remote-user-access.md) and [Manage SIP federated providers for your organization](../sip-providers/manage-sip-federated-providers-for-your-organization.md).

  - Enabling external user access for users in your organization. For details, see [Assign an external user access policy to a Skype for Business enabled user](../external-access-policies/assign-an-external-user-access-policy.md).
