# Manage SIP federated domains for your organization in Skype for Business Server


To manage and configure SIP domains that you can federate with, you can do the following:

  - Create or edit an allowed domain list of SIP federated partner domains.

  - Create or edit a blocked domain list of SIP federated domains.

To perform these tasks, use the procedures in this this section:

  - [Configure support for allowed external domains](configure-support-for-allowed-external-domains.md)

  - [Configure support for blocked external domains](configure-support-for-blocked-external-domains.md)
