# Invoke-CsPoolFailBack
 
Invokes the failback process for a Skype for Business Server 2015 pool. Failback is used after a pool has failed over and the users of that pool have been "failed over" to a backup pool. (That simply means users who were signed on to the failed pool are automatically signed on to the backup pool.) When the failed pool has been restored, the fail back process signs the failed-over users back to their original pool. This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.
  
```
Invoke-CsPoolFailBack -PoolFqdn <Fqdn> [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-DatabaseCommandTimeoutInSeconds <Int32>] [-DisasterMode <SwitchParameter>] [-Force <SwitchParameter>] [-SkipDataVerification <SwitchParameter>] [-WaitTime <TimeSpan>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

```

## Examples

### Example 1

In Example 1, failback is invoked for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com.
  
```
Invoke-CsPoolFailback -PoolFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"
```

## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The pool failover process provides a way for administrators to quickly restore service to users if the Registrar pool they have logged on to should suddenly become unavailable. If a pool fails, users will automatically be signed off from Skype for Business Server 2015; if they immediately try to log back on, they will be redirected to their specified backup pool.
  
To restore service to these users, administrators can run the **Invoke-CsPoolFailOver** cmdlet against the pool that is not currently available. Doing this will allow users to sign on to Skype for Business Server 2015 using the designated backup pool, and give these users access to all Skype for Business Server 2015 services and functionality. Note that users will not be rehomed on the backup pool; they will simply be allowed to log on and make use of that pool until their home pool has been restored. For example, if Pool A fails, users will be able to log on to Pool B (with complete functionality) until Pool A has been restored.
  
When the failed pool is once more up and running, administrators can then run the **Invoke-CsPoolFailBack** cmdlet in order to "fail back" users of that pool. If a user is currently logged on to the backup pool then he or she will be redirected back to their home pool after service has been restored.
  
 **Skype for Business Server Control Panel:** The functions carried out by the **Invoke-CsPoolFailback** cmdlet are not available in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _PoolFqdn_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Rtc.Management.Deploy.Fqdn  <br/> |Fully qualified domain name of the pool being failed back. For example:  <br/>  `-PoolFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"` <br/> The pool FQDN used during failback must be the same FQDN used during failover.  <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.  <br/> |
| _DatabaseCommandTimeoutInSeconds_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Int32  <br/> |The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for database commands to time out.  <br/> |
| _DisasterMode_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |Enables administrators to invoke pool failback even if the backup pool is currently unavailable. When you use this parameter, data generated by the failed-over users on the backup pool will be lost.  <br/> |
| _Force_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |Suppresses the display of any non-fatal error message that might arise when running the command.  <br/> |
| _SkipDataVerification_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |When included in a command, Invoke-CsPoolFailover will proceed with the failover operation without first verifying data integrity.  <br/> |
| _WaitTime_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.TimeSpan  <br/> |Specifies the maximum amount of time the cmdlet should wait before synching data. Time values must be express using the format hours:minutes:seconds; for example, the following syntax sets the wait time to 1 minute and 30 seconds (00 hours:01:minutes:30 seconds):  <br/>  `00:01:30` <br/> The default value is 15 seconds.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |Describes what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing the command.  <br/> |
| _HealthCheckOnly_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
| _IgnoreBackupServiceErrorState_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
| _IgnoreCMSDelay_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
| _NoPerformanceCounters_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
| _PrepareForFailbackOnly_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
| _PromptOnError_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
| _ServersToIgnore_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String   <br/> |PARAMVALUE: String   <br/> |
| _SkipFabricHealthCheck_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
