# Disable-CsComputer
 
Disables a service or server role that has been removed from a computer running Skype for Business Server 2015. This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
  
```
Disable-CsComputer [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-Force <SwitchParameter>] [-GlobalCatalog <Fqdn>] [-GlobalSettingsDomainController <Fqdn>] [-Report <String>] [-Scorch <SwitchParameter>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

```

## Examples

### EXAMPLE 1

The command shown in Example 1 disables the local computer.
  
```
Disable-CsComputer 
```

### EXAMPLE 2

The command shown in Examples 2 also disables the local computer. In addition to disabling the computer, however, this command records information about the success (or failure) of that task in the file C:\Logs\Disable.html. This log file is generated by adding the Report parameter followed by the path to the log file where you want the information recorded.
  
```
Disable-CsComputer -Report C:\Logs\Disable.html
```

## Detailed Description

Removing a service or server role from a computer does not automatically update the Skype for Business Server 2015 topology. Instead, that service or role must be disabled before the changes are fully updated in the topology. The **Disable-CsComputer** cmdlet provides a way for administrators to disable any services or server roles that have been removed from the local computer.
  
Unless you use the Scorch parameter, the **Disable-CsComputer** cmdlet does not uninstall the Skype for Business Server 2015 software; instead, it simply stops the computer from functioning in its previously assigned role.
