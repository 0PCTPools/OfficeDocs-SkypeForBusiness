# Setting up policies for Archiving in Lync Server 2013 when using Exchange Server integration
[]
If users homed on Exchange 2013 have their mailboxes put on In-Place Hold, Exchange In-Place Hold policies control archiving for those users. If you use Microsoft Exchange integration for your deployment, Exchange 2013 policies override Lync Server Archiving policies for users who are homed on Exchange 2013. For information about configuring Exchange Archiving policies, see the Exchange 2013 documentation. For details about setting up user policies for users homed on Lync Server 2013, see [Setting up user policies for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](setting-up-user-policies-for-archiving-in-lync-server.md) in the Deployment documentation. For details about how policies work, see [How Archiving works in Lync Server 2013](how-archiving-works.md) in the Planning documentation, Deployment documentation, or Operations documentation. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you deploy Exchange 2013 and Lync Server 2013 in the same forest, your Exchange 2013 In-Place Hold policies control archiving. If you deploy Exchange 2013 and Lync Server 2013 in separate forests, see "Deploying Lync Server and Microsoft Exchange in Different Forests" in [Deployment checklist for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](deployment-checklist-for-archiving.md).
