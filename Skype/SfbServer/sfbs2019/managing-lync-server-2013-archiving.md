[]
When you deploy Archiving for your organization, you specify the initial configuration during deployment. However, there may be times when you want to change how you implement archiving support for day-to-day management or to meet new requirements in your organization. For example, you may need to set up archiving support differently for a specific site, pool, or users within your organization. For users homed on Lync Server 2013, you do this be creating and customizing archiving policies and configurations. If you use Microsoft Exchange integration, you must also configure Exchange 2013 settings. This section provides information and procedures to enable you to make changes to your Archiving deployment.
