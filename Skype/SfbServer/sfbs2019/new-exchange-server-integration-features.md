# New Exchange Server integration features in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 supports new features when it is deployed alongside Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, as described in the following list. For each of these features to work, both Lync Server 2013 and Exchange 2013 must be deployed.
  
- You can use a **unified contact store**, in which the Lync contact list is stored in Exchange 2013, and you can manage the contact store in Lync 2013, Outlook 2013, and Outlook Web App.
    
- You can use **high-resolution photos** for contacts. Photos with up to 648x648 pixels are stored in Exchange 2013 and made available to clients including Lync 2013, Outlook 2013, Microsoft Lync Web App, and Outlook Web App. 
    
- You can enable **Lync Archiving integration**, which integrates Lync Server 2013 Archiving into the Exchange 2013 In-Place Hold feature, for users homed on Exchange 2013, which enables one common experience for administrators around compliance and eDiscovery.
