# Active Directory Domain Services requirements, support, and topologies in Lync Server 2013
[]

Prior to Lync Server 2010, Lync Server relied on Active Directory Domain Services to store all the global settings and groups necessary to deploy and manage Lync Server. Now much of this information is stored in the Central Management store instead of AD DS. However, user object schema extensions, including Lync Server 2013, Lync Server 2010, and Office Communications Server 2007 R2 schema extensions, are still stored in AD DS.
