# New and changed settings for Lync 2013
[]
This topic discusses changes to Lync Server Management Shell cmdlets that relate directly to client management. Lync Server 2013 introduces several new parameters, and deprecates parameters for features that can be configured through other means.
  
## New Client Management Parameters

|**New**|**Lync Server Management Shell Cmdlet**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|TracingLevel  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> | When set to True, software tracing will be enabled in Lync; when set to False, software tracing will be disabled. Software tracing involves keeping a detailed record of everything that a program does (including tracking API calls). Tracing is mostly useful to developers and to application support personnel.This setting is equivalent to the Communications Server 2007 R2 Group Policy setting "Turn on tracing for Communicator." The settings are as follows:  <br/>  Off = Tracing is disabled and the user cannot change this setting.  <br/>  Light = Minimal tracing is performed, and the user cannot change this setting.  <br/>  On = Verbose tracing is performed, and the user cannot change this setting.  <br/>  By default TracingLevel is set to a null value. That means that minimal tracing is performed, but the user can enable or disable this minimal tracing.  <br/> |
|EnableMediaRedirection  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> |When set to True ($True) allows audio and video streams to be separated from other network traffic, In turn, this allows client devices to do encoding and decoding of audio and video locally. Media redirection typically results in lower bandwidth usage, higher server scalability, and a more-optimal user experience compared to similar techniques such as device remoting or codec compression.  <br/> |
|AllowLargeMeetings  <br/> |CsConferencing  <br/> |When set to True, all Lync Meetings are treated as "large meetings." With a large meeting, restrictions are placed on the number of notifications that are sent to participants, in addition to the size of the meeting roster that is transmitted by default.  <br/> |
|DisablePowerPointAnnotations  <br/> |CsConferencing  <br/> |When set to True ($True) users won't be able to add annotations to PowerPoint slides used in a conference. However (depending on the value of the AllowAnnotations property), users will still have access to other whiteboarding features. The default value is False, meaning that PowerPoint annotations are allowed.  <br/> |
|AllowSharedNotes  <br/> |CsConferencing  <br/> |When set to True (the default value) any open OneNote notebooks linked to the conference will automatically be updated with information such as conference participants and details about content shared during the conference.  <br/> |
|EnableInviteCustomization  <br/> |CsMeetingConfiguration  <br/> |Used along with the other new CsMeetingConfiguration parameters to customize the meeting invitations generated by the Online Meeting Add-in for Lync 2013.  <br/> |
|LogoURL  <br/> |CsMeetingConfiguration  <br/> |Adds your organization's logo to all invitations generated by the Online Meeting Add-in for Lync 2013. You specify the URL of a GIF or JPG image.  <br/> |
|HelpURL  <br/> |CsMeetingConfiguration  <br/> |Adds your organization's help or support URL to all invitations generated by the Online Meeting Add-in for Lync 2013.  <br/> |
|LegalURL  <br/> |CsMeetingConfiguration  <br/> |Adds legal text or disclaimer text to all invitations generated by the Online Meeting Add-in for Lync 2013. You specify the URL for the location of the text.  <br/> |
|CustomFooterText  <br/> |CsMeetingConfiguration  <br/> |Adds a custom footer to all invitations generated by the Online Meeting Add-in for Lync 2013. You specify the URL for the location of the custom footer text.  <br/> |
   
### Deprecated Client Management Parameters

|**Parameter**|**Lync Server Management Shell Cmdlet**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|CustomizedHelpUrl  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> |This parameter has been deprecated for use with Lync Server 2013. When used in conjunction with EnableEnterpriseCustomizedHelp, this parameter enabled an organization to specify a URL so that when users clicked the Help menu in Lync, customized help would display.  <br/> |
|EnableEnterpriseCustomizedHelp  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> |This parameter has been deprecated for use with Lync Server 2013. When used in conjunction with CustomizedHelpUrl, this parameter enabled organizations to display customized help.  <br/> |
|EnableSQMData  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> |The EnableSQMData parameter of the Set-CSClientPolicy cmdlet has been removed in Lync Server 2013. Instead, you can use the shared Group Policy setting for Software Quality Management (SQM) data to determine the user interface for the Customer Experience Improvement option in the Lync client General options page:  <br/> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\Common\QMEnable  <br/> Values:  <br/> 1 = Display and select the check box (the user can clear the check box)  <br/> 0 = Turn off and disable the check box (user can't override)  <br/> Null = The value is determined by Office setup, and the check box is displayed for users to set as they choose  <br/> |
|AllowExchangeContactStore  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> |This parameter has been removed. Instead, when you deploy Lync Server 2013 and publish the topology, unified contact store is enabled for all users by default. This means that all a user's contacts are kept in Exchange and are available in Lync, Outlook, and Outlook Web Access. You can use the Set-CsUserServicesPolicy cmdlet to customize which users have unified contact store available. You can enable users globally, by site, by tenant, or by individuals or groups of individuals. For details, see [Enable users for unified contact store in Lync Server 2013](enable-users-for-unified-contact-store.md).  <br/> |
|MAPIPollInterval  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> |This parameter is not used by Lync 2013. In previous releases, this parameter specified how often the client retrieved MAPI data from Exchange public folders  <br/> |
|DisableICE  <br/> |CsClientPolicy  <br/> |This parameter was deprecated in Lync 2013.  <br/> |
