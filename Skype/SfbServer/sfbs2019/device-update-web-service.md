# Device Update Web service in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server includes the Device Update Web service, which is automatically installed as part of the Web Services role. This service lets you download updates from Microsoft, test them, and then deploy the updates to IP phones in your organization. You can also use Device Update Web service to roll back devices to previous software versions.
  
This section provides details about how to manage the Device Update Web service and deployed updates by using device update logs, rules (Lync Phone Edition uses rules to associate firmware version updates with hardware devices), and configuration settings. 
  
For details about the Device Update Web service process and features, see [Updating Devices](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg412864%28v=ocs.14%29.aspx) in the Lync Server 2010 TechNet Library. (Note that the Device Update Web service, like all Lync Phone Edition components, works the same way with Lync Server 2013 as it does with Lync Server 2010.)
