# Resetting or deleting external user access policies in Lync Server 2013
[]
If you have created or configured external user access policies that you no longer want to use, you can do the following:
  
- Delete any site or user policy that you created.
    
- Reset the global policy to the default settings. The default global policy settings deny any external user access. The global policy cannot be deleted.
