# Modify the default URL filter in Lync Server 2013
[]
By using the instant messaging (IM) filter, Lync Server 2013 provides a global URL filter that blocks specific URLs contained in IM conversations among users throughout your Lync Server 2013 deployment. By using Lync Server Control Panel, you can do the following:
  
- Block all or a subset of URLs in instant message conversations.
    
- Allow all URLs. As an option, you can create a notice that is inserted at the beginning of each instant message that contains a URL.
    
- Allow specific URLs and include a warning with each instant message that contains a URL.
    
In addition, you can choose to block URLs that contain specific file types, or block only Internet URLs by allowing URLs that are within the server's local intranet zone — intranet URLs — to pass through the server. For details about URL filtering, see [Configuring file transfer and URL filtering for instant messaging (IM) in Lync Server 2013](configuring-file-transfer-and-url-filtering-for-instant-messaging-im.md).
