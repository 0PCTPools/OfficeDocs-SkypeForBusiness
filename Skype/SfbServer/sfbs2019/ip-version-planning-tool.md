# IP Version (Planning Tool)
[]
You have three options when configuring IP addresses in Lync Server 2013. You can configure Lync Server 2013 to support only IP version 4 (IPv4), only IP version 6 (IPv6), or a combination of both (known as a dual stack).
  
For more details about choosing your IP infrastructure, see [Planning for and configuring IPv6 in Lync Server 2013](planning-for-and-configuring-ipv6.md).
