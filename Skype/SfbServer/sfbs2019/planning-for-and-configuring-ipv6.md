description: "Lync Server 2013 includes support for IP version 6 (IPv6) addresses, along with continued support of IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses that allow a computer to communicate over the Internet. Due to the increasing number of devices worldwide, the available IPv4 addresses have run out. Because of this, many new devices are moving to using IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses perform the same function as IPv4 addresses (with some additional features), but instead of using only 32-bits, IPv6 addresses use 128-bits. This provides not only a new set of addresses, but also a much larger number of them. A typical IPv4 address looks something like this: 192.0.2.235, whereas an IPv6 address looks like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. The change in formatting and functionality for devices that use IPv6 addresses requires several deployment and configuration considerations in your Lync Server 2013 installation."

# Planning for and configuring IPv6 in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 includes support for IP version 6 (IPv6) addresses, along with continued support of IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit addresses that allow a computer to communicate over the Internet. Due to the increasing number of devices worldwide, the available IPv4 addresses have run out. Because of this, many new devices are moving to using IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses perform the same function as IPv4 addresses (with some additional features), but instead of using only 32-bits, IPv6 addresses use 128-bits. This provides not only a new set of addresses, but also a much larger number of them. A typical IPv4 address looks something like this: 192.0.2.235, whereas an IPv6 address looks like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. The change in formatting and functionality for devices that use IPv6 addresses requires several deployment and configuration considerations in your Lync Server 2013 installation.
