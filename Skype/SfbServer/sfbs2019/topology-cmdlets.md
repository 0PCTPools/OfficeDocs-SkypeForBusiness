# Topology cmdlets jn Lync Server 2013
[]
Many of the topology cmdlets included in Microsoft Lync Server 2013 are designed for use with Setup and Topology Builder; because of that, there are a number of topology cmdlets that administrators will rarely call directly. However, there will be times when administrators will be required to use these cmdlets; for example, after creating new Kerberos accounts you must run the [Enable-CsTopology](enable-cstopology.md) cmdlet to cause the changes to take effect. In addition, administrators will likely run cmdlets such as [Test-CsTopology](test-cstopology.md) and [Test-CsComputer](test-cscomputer.md) to help ensure that Lync Server 2013 has been correctly installed and is working as expected. 
  
## Topology Cmdlets

The following is a list of cmdlets that relate directly managing your Lync Server topology: 
  
 **Topology**
  
> [Get-CsPool](get-cspool.md)
    
> [Get-CsSite](get-cssite.md)
    
> [Set-CsSite](set-cssite.md)
    
> [Enable-CsTopology](enable-cstopology.md)
    
> [Get-CsTopology](get-cstopology.md)
    
> [Publish-CsTopology](publish-cstopology.md)
    
> [Test-CsTopology](test-cstopology.md)
    
> [Export-CsConfiguration](export-csconfiguration.md)
    
> [Import-CsConfiguration](import-csconfiguration.md)
    
> [Get-CsServerVersion](get-csserverversion.md)
    
> [Disable-CsComputer](disable-cscomputer.md)
    
> [Enable-CsComputer](enable-cscomputer.md)
    
> [Get-CsComputer](get-cscomputer.md)
    
> [Test-CsComputer](test-cscomputer.md)
    
> [Get-CsNetworkInterface](get-csnetworkinterface.md)
