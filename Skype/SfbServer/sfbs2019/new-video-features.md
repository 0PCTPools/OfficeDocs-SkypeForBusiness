# New video features in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 introduces the following new video features:
  
- **HD video** Users can experience resolutions up to HD 1080P in two-party calls and multiparty conferences. 
    
- **Gallery View** In video conferences that have more than two people, users can see videos of participants in the conference. If the conference has more than five participants, video of only the most active participants appear in the top row, and a photo appears for the other participants. 
    
- **H.264 video** The H.264 video codec is now the default for encoding video on Lync 2013 clients. H.264 video supports a greater range of resolutions and frame rates, and improves video scalability.
