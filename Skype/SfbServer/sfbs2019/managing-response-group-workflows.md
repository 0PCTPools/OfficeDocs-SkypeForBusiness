# Managing Response Group workflows in Lync Server 2013
[]
A Response Group workflow defines the behavior of a call from the time that the phone rings to the time that an agent answers the call. The workflow includes queue and routing information, and includes either hunt group or interactive voice response (IVR) information.
  
Topics in this section identify best practices for designing IVR workflows, and explain how to create customized business hours and holiday sets, how to create or modify workflows, and how to delete workgroups.
