You can add a test device to the **Test Device** page and then use this device to verify the functionality of new updates before deploying the updates to production devices. You can test a device globally (throughout your entire Lync Server environment) or within a single site. You identify a test device by its Media Access Control (MAC) address or serial number. When you add a device, it appears in the list on the **Test Device** page of the Lync Server Control Panel.

You can perform the following tasks on the **New Test Device** or **Edit Test Device** page: 
  
- Add a new test device.
