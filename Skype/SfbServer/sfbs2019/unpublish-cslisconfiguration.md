```

## Detailed Description
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

In order to implement Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) in Lync Server, you must create a location mapping (called a wiremap). This mapping includes matching physical addresses to ports, subnets, switches, and wireless access points so emergency calls made over an Enterprise Voice connection will reach the nearest emergency operator and provide that operator with the correct location of the caller. This mapping configuration, created by calling cmdlets such as the **Set-CsLisPort** cmdlet and the **Set-CsLisSubnet** cmdlet, is stored in the location configuration database. A configuration can be committed from the location configuration database to the Central Management store by calling the **Publish-CsLisConfiguration** cmdlet, which allows for replication of the data to the Location Information Server. The **Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration** cmdlet removes the LIS configuration from the Central Management store. 
  
Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the **Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration** cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins. To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt: 
  
Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Unpublish-CsLisConfiguration"}
