# Lync Server 2013 Response Group Configuration Tool Help
[]
This section includes user interface reference topics that apply to the Response Group Configuration Tool. You use the Response Group Configuration Tool to create Response Group workflows for Lync Server 2013.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you have more than 300 workflows in a single pool in your Response Group deployment, it is better to use Lync Server Management Shell cmdlets to create the workflows. If you use the Response Group Configuration Tool to create workflows for a pool that has more than 300 workflows, the webpage takes a long time to load.
