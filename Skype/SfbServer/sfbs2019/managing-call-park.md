# Managing Call Park in Lync Server 2013
[]
The Call Park application enables an Enterprise Voice user to put a call on hold from one telephone and then retrieve the call later from any telephone. When the user parks a call, Lync Server transfers the call to a temporary number, called an orbit, where the call is held until someone retrieves it or it times out.
