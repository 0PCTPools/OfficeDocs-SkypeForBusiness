# New role based access control features in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 enhances the role-based access control (RBAC) feature in two major ways. You can now create custom roles, which each have privileges for only a set of cmdlets you specify. These custom roles can also be given privilege to run scripts of cmdlets. 
  
Additionally, Lync Server 2013 includes two new predefined roles.
  
- Users given the Response Group Manager role can manage specific Response Group queues in your organization, but not necessarily have management rights for other queues or the Response Group application as a whole. 
    
- Users given the Persistent Chat Manager role can manage specific Persistent Chat rooms in your organization, but not necessarily have management rights for other rooms or the Persistent Chat feature as a whole.
