# Select the Central Management Server in Lync Server 2013
[]
Before you can define and configure your topology, you must first define the location to install the Central Management Server.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This will not take effect until you have published a topology in Topology Builder. To set the Central Management Server before the topology is created and published, run **Set-CSConfigurationStoreLocation**. 
  
### To select the Central Management Server

1. Start Topology Builder: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Topology Builder**.
    
2. Right-click the Lync Server 2013 node, and then click **Edit Properties**.
    
3. In the Central Management Server pane, select the Front End Server to install the Central Management Server on and then click **OK**.
