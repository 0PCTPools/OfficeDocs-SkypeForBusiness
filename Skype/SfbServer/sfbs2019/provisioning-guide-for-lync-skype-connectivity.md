# Provisioning guide for Lync-Skype connectivity in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 supports connectivity with Skype. This connectivity enables your Lync 2013 users to add Skype contacts by using the Skype user's Microsoft Account (MSA). Skype clients can also add Lync users to their contact list. Based on policies administratively set in Lync Server, Lync and Skype users will be able to communicate using instant messaging, see each other's presence, and initiate audio and video calls. Lync-Skype connectivity is also a feature of Lync Online, and can be enabled for Lync Online customers from the Lync Administration Center within the Office 365 portal.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If Lync Server is already configured to connect with Windows Messenger by using Public Instant Messaging Connectivity (PIC), your deployment is already configured for Lync-Skype connectivity. The only change you may want to consider is to rename your existing Messenger PIC entry as Skype. For details, see Configure the Skype PIC provider setting for Lync later in this guide.
