description: "Lync Server 2013 supports Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) services within the United States as part of an Enterprise Voice deployment. E9-1-1 is an emergency dispatch feature that associates a 9-1-1 call with an Emergency Response Location (ERL) that consists of civic (that is, street) addresses and other more specific location information, such as floor numbers, for calls from office buildings and other multitenant facilities. By using the provided ERL, a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) can immediately dispatch first responders to the caller in distress with reduced risk of inadvertently directing the responder to an incorrect or ambiguous location."

# Planning for emergency services (E9-1-1) in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 supports Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) services within the United States as part of an Enterprise Voice deployment. E9-1-1 is an emergency dispatch feature that associates a 9-1-1 call with an Emergency Response Location (ERL) that consists of civic (that is, street) addresses and other more specific location information, such as floor numbers, for calls from office buildings and other multitenant facilities. By using the provided ERL, a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) can immediately dispatch first responders to the caller in distress with reduced risk of inadvertently directing the responder to an incorrect or ambiguous location.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Lync Server has three advanced Enterprise Voice features: call admission control, emergency services (E9-1-1), and media bypass. For an overview of planning information that is common to all three of these features, see [Network settings for the advanced Enterprise Voice features in Lync Server 2013](network-settings-for-the-advanced-enterprise-voice-features.md).
