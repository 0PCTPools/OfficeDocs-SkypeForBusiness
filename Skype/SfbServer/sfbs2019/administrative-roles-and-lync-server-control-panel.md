# Administrative Roles and Lync Server Control Panel
[]
To enable you to delegate administrative tasks while maintaining high standards for security,Lync Server 2013 supports role-based access control (RBAC). With RBAC, you grant administrative privilege by assigning users to predefined administrative roles. Lync Server includes a rich set of built-in administrative roles, and also enables you to create new roles and specify a custom list of cmdlets for each new role. You can also add scripts of cmdlets to the allowed tasks of both predefined and custom RBAC roles. For details, including the predefined administrative roles available in Lync Server, see [Planning for role-based access control in Lync Server 2013](planning-for-role-based-access-control-rbac.md).
