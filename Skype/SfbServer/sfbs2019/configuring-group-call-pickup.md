# Configuring Group Call Pickup in Lync Server 2013
[]
Cumulative update for Lync Server 2013: February 2013 introduces Group Call Pickup as a new Enterprise Voice feature. Group Call Pickup lets users pick up calls that are ringing for another user by dialing a call pickup group number.
  
The components that Group Call Pickup uses are automatically installed and enabled on the Front End Server or Standard Edition server when you deploy Enterprise Voice. However, you must configure Group Call Pickup before it is available to users. 
  
This section guides you through the configuration of Group Call Pickup.
