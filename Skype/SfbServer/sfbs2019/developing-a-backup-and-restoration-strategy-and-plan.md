The effectiveness of your Lync Server backup and restoration operations depends on your backup and restoration strategy and plan. You should establish a strategy for backing up and restoring Lync Server that fits with your organization's overall strategy, and a comprehensive, concise plan for backing up data and settings, and, in the event of an outage, a plan for restoring service.
