# Managing Response Group queues in Lync Server 2013
[]
Queues hold calls to a response group until an agent answers the call. When you manage a queue, you assign one or more agent groups to the queue and specify queue settings, such as the number of calls that the queue can hold before performing an overflow action and the length of time that a call waits for an agent before performing a time-out action. When the Response Group application searches for an available agent, it searches agent groups in the order that you list them.
