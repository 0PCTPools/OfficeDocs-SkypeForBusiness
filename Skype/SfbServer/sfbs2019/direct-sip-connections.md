# Direct SIP connections in Lync Server 2013
[]
You can use direct SIP connections to connect Lync Server to either of the following: 
  
- An IP-PBX (for details, see [Direct SIP deployment options in Lync Server 2013](direct-sip-deployment-options.md)).
    
- A PSTN gateway (for details, see [PSTN gateway deployment options in Lync Server 2013](pstn-gateway-deployment-options.md)).
    
To implement a direct SIP connection, you follow essentially the same deployment steps as you would to implement a SIP trunk. In both cases, you implement the connection by using the external interface of a Mediation Server. The only difference is that you connect SIP trunks to an external entity, such as an ITSP gateway, and you connect direct SIP connections to an internal entity within your local network, such as an IP-PBX or a public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway.
