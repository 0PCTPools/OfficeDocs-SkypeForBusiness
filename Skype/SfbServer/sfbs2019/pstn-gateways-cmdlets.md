# PSTN gateways cmdlets in Lync Server 2013
[]
PSTN gateways enable your Enterprise Voice users to make phone calls to, and receive phone calls from, people on the PSTN network (that is, the public switched telephone network). These gateways act as a bridge between the Mediation Server and the PSTN network.
  
## PSTN Gateways Cmdlets

The [Test-CsPstnOutboundCall](test-cspstnoutboundcall.md) and [Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall](test-cspstnpeertopeercall.md) cmdlets enable you to verify that users are able to make call over the PSTN network.
