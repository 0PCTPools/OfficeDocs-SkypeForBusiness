# Configure SQL Server in Lync Server 2013
[]
For each database that you deploy, you can use a single SQL Server instance for all databases for your Lync Server 2013 deployment that can be collocated on a database server. For details about database collocation, see [Supported server collocation in Lync Server 2013](supported-server-collocation.md) in the Supportability documentation. 
  
Additionally, each SQL Server instance must be installed and available prior to completing the steps in Topology Builder that set up the databases, or manually creating the databases with Windows PowerShell cmdlets. For details about SQL Server supportability, see [Hardware setup for Lync Server 2013](hardware-setup.md).
