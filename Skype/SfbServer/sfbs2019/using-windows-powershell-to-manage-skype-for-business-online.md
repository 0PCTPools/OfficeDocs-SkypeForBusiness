# Using Windows PowerShell to manage Skype for Business Online
[]
With the June 2013 release of Skype for Business Online, administrators are now able to use Windows PowerShell to manage their Skype for Business Online deployment and their Skype for Business Online user accounts. A number of articles have been written to introduce Windows PowerShell as a management tool, and to help you make the best and most efficient use of this new capability when administering Skype for Business Online. These articles include:
  
- [An introduction to Windows PowerShell and Skype for Business Online](an-introduction-to-windows-powershell-and-skype-for-business-online.md) . Designed for administrators with limited experience with Windows PowerShell, this article explains what Windows PowerShell is and how Windows PowerShell relates to the Skype for Business Online admin center.

- [Managing Skype for Business Online and Microsoft Exchange from the same remote Windows PowerShell session](managing-skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-exchange-from-the-same-remote-w.md) .

- [Using Windows PowerShell in a hybrid deployment with Skype for Business Online](using-windows-powershell-in-a-hybrid-deployment.md) . Provides an introduction to using Windows PowerShell in a hybrid deployment: a deployment where some users have accounts homed on Skype for Business Online and other users have accounts homed on an on-premises implementation of Lync Server. 
    
- [Diagnosing and resolving connection problems with Skype for Business Online](diagnosing-and-resolving-connection-problems-with-skype-for-business-online.md) .

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In March, 2014 a new version of the Skype for Business Online Connector module was posted to the Download center. Most users will be still able to connect to Skype for Business Online by using the previous version of the module (version number 5.0.8643.0). However, to ensure that you continue to get the latest updates it is recommended that you install the March, 2014 version of the Connector module anyway. Running the installation program will uninstall the previous version of the Connector module and then install the March, 2014 update. For more information, see the help topic [Downloading and installing the Skype for Business Online Connector module](downloading-and-installing-the-skype-for-business-online-connector-module.md).
