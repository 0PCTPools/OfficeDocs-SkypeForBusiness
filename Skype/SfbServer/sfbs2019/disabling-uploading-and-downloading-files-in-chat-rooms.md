# Disabling uploading and downloading files in chat rooms in Lync Server 2013
[]
By default, users can upload and download files in the messages that they post. You can disable this functionality and prevent users from uploading and downloading files in two ways:
  
- Prevent all users from uploading and downloading files in a certain Persistent Chat room or chat room category.
    
- Prevent a certain user from uploading and downloading files in any chat room. The user cannot upload and download files in any chat room, including chat rooms that allow file uploading and downloading.
    
For details about enabling and disabling file uploading and downloading, see [Configure categories in Lync Server 2013](configure-categories.md) and [Manage categories](manage-categories.md) in the Deployment documentation.
