# Installing the Operation Manager agent files on a watcher node in Lync Server 2013
[]
Similar to setting up a Lync Server to report component alerts, a Lync Server 2013 watcher node requires System Center Operations Manager agent files to be installed. This will enable the synthetic transactions to be run and for alerts to be reported to the System Center Operations Manager Root Management Server.
  
To install the agent files, follow the same procedures listed in the following sections:
  
1. [Installing a certificate on a watcher node located outside the perimeter network of Lync Server 2013](installing-a-certificate-on-a-watcher-node-located-outside-the-perimeter-network.md)
    
2. [Installing the Operation Manager agent files in Lync Server 2013](installing-the-operation-manager-agent-files.md)
    
3. [Configuring the Lync Server 2013 computer to participate in System Center discovery](configuring-the-lync-server-computer-to-participate-in-system-center-discovery.md)
