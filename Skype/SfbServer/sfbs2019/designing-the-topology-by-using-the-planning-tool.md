# Designing the topology for Lync Server 2013 by using the Planning Tool
[]
The Microsoft Lync Server 2013, Planning Tool is a wizard driven, interview-like tool that asks questions about the Lync Server 2013 topology that you are designing. The Planning Tool uses the information supplied, coupled with preferred practices for topology design and capacity, to present a recommended topology based on the answers supplied. You can download the Planning Tool from the Microsoft Downloads Center ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=282725](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=282725)).
  
Ultimately, the goal of the Planning Tool is to ease the potential complexity of designing a complete Lync Server 2013 topology. The tool also provides contextual references to planning and deployment documentation inside the tool, provided that an Internet connection is available to connect to the Microsoft TechNet website.
  
After customizing the topology with the infrastructure's TCP/IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), the Planning Tool makes available a series of reports that cover Domain Name System (DNS) naming, firewall rules, certificates, and more. 
  
The Planning Tool also provides the ability to export information in two formats:
  
- Microsoft Excel
    
- Microsoft Visio
    
The following topics introduce and detail the Planning Tool.
