# Select Normalization Rules
[]
Lync Server 2013 normalization rules use .NET Framework regular expressions to translate dialed phone numbers to E.164 format. Each dial plan must be assigned one or more normalization rules.
  
To use an existing normalization rule, click a rule in the list and then click **OK**.
  
For details about the different procedures that you can perform by using the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel, see [Operations in Lync Server 2013](operations.md).
