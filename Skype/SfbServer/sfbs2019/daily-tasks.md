# Daily tasks in Lync Server 2013
[]
To help ensure the availability and reliability of the Lync Server 2013 deployment, you should as part of daily routine monitor and test elements that are very important to the functioning of the system, which includes the physical platform, the operating system, and all important Lync Server 2013 services. Preventive maintenance and proactive monitoring will help you identify potential errors and issues that may adversely affect the Lync Server 2013 deployment. 
  
Monitoring the Lync Server 2013 deployment involves checking for issues with connections, services, server resources, and system resources. Windows Server operating systems, together with System Center Operations Manager, and Lync Server give you many monitoring tools and services to help ensure that the Lync Server organization is running smoothly. When these technologies are implemented together, administrators will be able to receive alerts when or before issues occur. 
  
The key advantages to daily monitoring are as follows:
  
- Meeting the performance and availability requirements of defined SLAs.
    
- Successfully completing specific administrative tasks, such as daily backup operations, and checking server health.
    
- Detecting and addressing issues, such as bottlenecks in the server performance, or need for additional resources before they affect productivity.
    
Daily maintenance tasks help the administrative team to define or establish a criteria or baseline for normal systems operations within the organization, and to detect any abnormal activity. It is important to implement these daily maintenance tasks so that the administrative team can capture and maintain data about the Lync Server 2013 infrastructure, such as usage levels, possible performance bottlenecks, and administrative changes. 
  
To help organize the performance of daily tasks, use the [Daily task checklist](operations-checklists.md#Daily_task).
