description: "The Lync Server Announcement application lets you configure the handling of incoming phone calls when the dialed number is valid for your organization, but is not assigned to a user or a phone. You can transfer these calls to a predetermined destination (phone number, SIP URI, or voice mail), or play an audio announcement, or both. The Announcement application helps you avoid the situations in which a caller misdials and hears a busy tone or the SIP client receives an error message.

The Announcement application helps you avoid the situations in which a caller misdials and hears a busy tone or the SIP client receives an error message.
