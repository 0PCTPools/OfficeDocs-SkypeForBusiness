# Planning for branch-site voice resiliency in Lync Server 2013
[]
If you want to provide branch-site resiliency, that is, high-availability Enterprise Voice service, you have three options for doing so:
  
- Survivable Branch Appliance
    
- Survivable Branch Server
    
- A full Lync Server deployment at the branch site 
    
This guide will help you evaluate which resiliency solution is best for your organization and, based on your resiliency solution, which PSTN-connectivity solution to use. It will also help you prepare to deploy the solution that you choose by describing prerequisites and other planning considerations.
