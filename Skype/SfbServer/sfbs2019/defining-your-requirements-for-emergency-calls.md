# Defining your requirements for emergency calls in Lync Server 2013
[]
Before you begin a Microsoft Lync Server 2013 E9-1-1 deployment, you should first be able to answer the questions detailed in the following sections. The planning you need to do depends on the type of E9-1-1 solution that you choose to deploy—a SIP trunk E9-1-1 service provider or an Emergency Location Identification Number (ELIN) gateway. The following table identifies the sections in this planning workbook that you'll need to review for each of those solutions.
