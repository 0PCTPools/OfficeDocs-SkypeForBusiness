# A/V conferencing requirements in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 infrastructure requirements for conferencing are the same as for deployment of Lync Server 2013. For details, see [Determining your infrastructure requirements for Lync Server 2013](determining-your-infrastructure-requirements.md) in the Planning documentation. 
  
It is important that you have the necessary Media bandwidth to handle media traffic generated by conferencing. For details that you can use to calculate your needed bandwidth, see [Network bandwidth requirements for media traffic in Lync Server 2013](network-bandwidth-requirements-for-media-traffic.md). For details about limiting the bandwidth, see [Creating or modifying bandwidth policy profiles in Lync Server 2013](creating-or-modifying-bandwidth-policy-profiles.md). For details about infrastructure requirements, see [Network infrastructure requirements for Lync Server 2013](network-infrastructure-requirements.md).
  
In order to use the conferencing features, Lync Server 2013 requires that certain ports are open. For details about Port Requirements, see [Ports and protocols for internal servers in Lync Server 2013](ports-and-protocols-for-internal-servers.md). For details about configuring ports, see [Configuring port ranges in Lync Server 2013 for your Conferencing, Application, and Mediation servers](configuring-port-ranges-for-your-conferencing-application-and-mediation-servers.md).
