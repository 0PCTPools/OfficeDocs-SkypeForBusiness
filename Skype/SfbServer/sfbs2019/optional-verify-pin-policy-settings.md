# (Optional) Verify PIN policy settings in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 users who have Active Directory Domain Services credentials can enter a personal identification number (PIN) to join dial-in conferences as authenticated users. A PIN policy defines the rules for how dial-in conferencing PINs work.
  
When you deploy dial-in conferencing, you should verify that the default global PIN policy meets your requirements. If you need to make changes, you can modify the default global policy or you can create a new PIN policy. You can create PIN policies that apply to a specific site, a specific user, or a specific group of users.
