# Reviewing the DNS Report in Lync Server 2013
[]
The DNS Report, which is part of the Administrator Report, details all of the recommended and known entries for the Domain Name System (DNS) in the internal, perimeter, and external networks. If the designer has completed the edits to the network diagram, and all IP addresses and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) are defined to their production values, the DNS Report provides an excellent configuration resource. This report can also serve as an operational troubleshooting document.

You should have your DNS management team review the DNS Report thoroughly to make sure that there are no errors that may cause difficulty during deployment or that may complicate a troubleshooting session.
