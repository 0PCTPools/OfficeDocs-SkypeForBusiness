# Mediation Collocation (Planning Tool)
[]
The Mediation Server is collocated with the Front End Server by default. The Mediation Server can also be deployed in a stand-alone pool for performance reasons, or if you deploy SIP trunking, in which case the stand-alone pool is strongly recommended. For details, see the following topics:
  
- [Supported server collocation in Lync Server 2013](supported-server-collocation.md)
    
- [Mediation Server component in Lync Server 2013](mediation-server-component.md)
