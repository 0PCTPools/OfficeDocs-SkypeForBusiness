# Separate large-meeting calendar in Lync Server 2013
[]
For each large-meeting pool, you should maintain a separate a calendar of large meetings scheduled on that pool. For example, you can home a single user account on the large-meeting pool and use Outlook with Exchange and Online Meeting Add-in for Lync 2013 to maintain a separate calendar. If you use multiple user accounts to enable a support staff to create large meetings, you can set up a separate calendar that aggregates all large meetings created by the members of the support staff. 
  
Maintaining a separate large meeting calendar helps to prevent conflicts and ensure that only one large meeting is active at any time.
