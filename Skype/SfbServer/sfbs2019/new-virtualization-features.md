description: "Lync Server 2013 supports virtualization on both Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2008 R2. Support on Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 includes support for the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) capabilities. With SR-IOV, the virtual function of a physical network adapter is assigned directly to a virtual machine. This increases network throughput and reduces network latency while also reducing the host CPU overhead that is required for processing network traffic. To take advantage of SR-IOV, you must use a host server which has BIOS which supports SR-IOV, as well as use network adapters that support SR-IOV."

Lync Server 2013 supports virtualization on both Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
