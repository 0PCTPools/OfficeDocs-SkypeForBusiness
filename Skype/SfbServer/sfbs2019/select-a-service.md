Use the **Select a Service** dialog box to find services available in your Lync Server 2013 environment. To use an existing service, click a service in the list and then click **OK**. 
  
For details about the different procedures that you can perform by using the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel, see [Operations in Lync Server 2013](operations.md).
  
## Tasks you can perform
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

You can perform the following tasks on the **Select a Service** page: 
  
- [Configure categories in Lync Server 2013](configure-categories.md)
    
- [Configure add-ins for rooms in Lync Server 2013](configure-add-ins-for-rooms.md)
    
- [Configure Persistent Chat Server options globally or for Persistent Chat Server pool in Lync Server 2013](configure-persistent-chat-server-options-globally-or-for-persistent-chat-server.md)
    
For details about the different procedures that you can perform by using the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel, see [Operations in Lync Server 2013](operations.md).
  
## To configure categories for chat rooms
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

In **Select a Service**, select the service corresponding to the Persistent Chat Server pool on which the category needs to be created. The service is the Persistent Chat Server pool that the Persistent Chat (client) uses to identify which pool the category belongs to. A category can belong to only one Persistent Chat Server pool, and cannot be moved to another one, or shared with another pool. 
  
## To configure add-ins for chat rooms
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

In **Select a Service**, select the service corresponding to the Persistent Chat Server pool where you need to create the Add-in. Add-ins cannot be moved from one pool to another or shared between different pools.
  
## To configure Persistent Chat options for a specific Persistent Chat Server pool
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

In **Select a Service**, select the service associated with the Persistent Chat Server pool to be configured.
