# Dial-in conferencing access numbers in Lync Server 2013
[]
To enable users to join the audio portion of on-premises conferences by dialing in from the public switched telephone network (PSTN), you must configure dial-in conferencing access numbers. Dial-in conferencing access numbers are the numbers that users call to join a conference.
  
Dial-in access numbers are displayed in meeting invitations and on the Dial-in Conferencing Settings webpage.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use a new dial-in access number until Active Directory replication of that access number is complete. Replication can take several hours.
