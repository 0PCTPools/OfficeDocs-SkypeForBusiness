# Configuring Lync Server 2013 hybrid deployments
[]
This section describes the steps necessary for configuring hybrid Lync Server 2013 deployments.
  
## In this section

- If you have an on-premises Lync deployment, and want to move some users to the cloud to use Lync Online in Office 365, see [Configuring an on-premises deployment for hybrid with Lync Online](configuring-an-on-premises-deployment-for-hybrid-with-lync-online.md).
    
- If you have users enabled for Lync in Lync Online, but that have not been enabled in an on-premises deployment, see [Moving users from Lync Online to Lync on-premises in Lync Server 2013](moving-users-from-lync-online-to-lync-on-premises.md).
