# Configure dial-in conferencing personal identification number (PIN) rules in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 users who have Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) credentials in your organization can join dial-in conferences as authenticated users by using a personal identification number (PIN). PIN policy defines the rules for how dial-in conferencing PINs work.
  
You can create a new PIN policy if you want a specific policy to apply to a site or to a certain group of users. If you want to use the same PIN policy for your entire organization, you can use the global PIN policy and modify it as needed. PIN policies apply to users from the narrowest scope to the widest scope. If you assign a user-level PIN policy to a user, those settings take precedence. If you do not assign a user policy, the site-level PIN policy applies, if it exists. If no user or site policies apply, global PIN policy provides the default settings.
