# Add Front End Associations 2010
[]
You can enable support for specific features that require the deployment of other servers by associating the server roles with the Front End pool at this time. You can also associate server roles with the Front End pool at a later time. The server roles that can be associated with a Front End pool include the following:
  
1. Archiving Server. For details about planning and implementing archiving support, see [Defining your requirements for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](defining-your-organization-s-requirements-for-archiving.md) in the Planning documentation and [Define and configure a Front End pool or Standard Edition server in Lync Server 2013](define-and-configure-a-front-end-pool-or-standard-edition-server.md) and [Deploying Archiving in Lync Server 2013](deploying-archiving.md) in the Deployment documentation. 
    
2. Monitoring Server. For details about implementing monitoring support, see [Planning for monitoring in Lync Server 2013](planning-for-monitoring.md) in the Planning documentation and [Define and configure a Front End pool or Standard Edition server in Lync Server 2013](define-and-configure-a-front-end-pool-or-standard-edition-server.md) and [Deploying monitoring in Lync Server 2013](deploying-monitoring.md) in the Deployment documentation. 
    
3. A/V Edge service. For details about implementing an A/V Edge service, see [Overview of external user access in Lync Server 2013](overview-of-external-user-access.md).
