# Restoring a Lync Server pool in Lync Server 2013
[]
Your Lync Server deployment may include any of the following types of pools:
  
- Front End Server
    
- Mediation Server
    
- Persistent Chat Server
    
- Edge Server
    
If an entire pool experiences an outage, follow these procedures for each member server in the pool. 
  
- For a Front End pool, restore the Back End Server first, and then restore each Front End Server. For details, see [Restoring an Enterprise Edition Back End Server in Lync Server 2013](restoring-an-enterprise-edition-back-end-server.md) and [Restoring an Enterprise Edition member server in Lync Server 2013](restoring-an-enterprise-edition-member-server.md).
    
- For all other types of pools, restore each member server. For details, see [Restoring an Enterprise Edition member server in Lync Server 2013](restoring-an-enterprise-edition-member-server.md).
