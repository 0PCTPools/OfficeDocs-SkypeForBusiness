# Backing up Archiving and Monitoring databases in Lync Server 2013
[]
If you deployed Archiving or Monitoring, you need to back up these databases according to your organization's SQL Server backup policy.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The settings for Archiving and Monitoring are backed up when you back up the Central Management store. For details, see [Backing up core data and settings in Lync Server 2013](backing-up-core-data-and-settings.md). 
  
For Archiving and Monitoring, you can use a SQL Server tool such as SQL Server Management Studio to perform a manual backup, or you can use SQL Server management tools to schedule regular, automatic backups.
