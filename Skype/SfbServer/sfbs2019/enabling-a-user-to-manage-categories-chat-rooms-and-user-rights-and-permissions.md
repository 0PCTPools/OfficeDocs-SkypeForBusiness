Members of the **CsPersistentChatAdministrator** role (Persistent Chat administrators) can grant chat room manager rights and permissions to other users and to themselves. 
  
A Persistent Chat administrator can do the following:

- Set the membership of all categories and chat rooms.
    
- Manage all settings of all categories and chat rooms.
    
- Enable or disable policy for Persistent Chat Server.
    
- Set and manage configuration settings on a Persistent Chat Server pool.
