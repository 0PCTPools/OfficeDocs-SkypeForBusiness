# E9-1-1 support in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 supports Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) as part of an enterprise deployment. E9-1-1 is an emergency notification feature that associates the calling party's telephone number with a civic (that is, a street) address. E9-1-1 support is available only in the United States. 
  
To support E9-1-1 as part of a Lync Server 2013 deployment, you must obtain E9-1-1 routing service from a certified emergency services provider or use an Emergency Location Identification Number (ELIN) gateway. The emergency services provider or carrier routes emergency calls that originate from Lync Server 2013 to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), based on the location information contained within the call. For details about E9-1-1 support, see [Planning for emergency services (E9-1-1) in Lync Server 2013](planning-for-emergency-services-e9-1-1.md) in the Planning documentation.
