Backing up the Lync Server File Stores includes all the files and folders used by Lync Server components.
  
### To back up File Stores

1. To find the specific locations of your Lync Server File Stores, open Topology Builder and look in the **File stores** node. 
    
2. Use Robocopy or another file system management tool to copy each File Store to $Backup\filestore.
