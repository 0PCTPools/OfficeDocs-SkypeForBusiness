# Scaled Director pool - hardware load balancer in Lync Server 2013
[]
A scaled Director pool, where there are more than one Director is deployed to handle additional capacity and to provide high availability, requires load balancing to distribute client and server communication to all members of the pool. A Director hosts web services much like a Front End pool. Hardware load balancing is required for the web services.
  
The following topics describe the planning considerations for deploying a Director pool using hardware load balancing. If you intend to use hardware load balancing and DNS load balancing for the Director pool, see the topic [Scaled Director pool - DNS load balancing and hardware load balancer in Lync Server 2013](scaled-director-pooldns-load-balancing-and-hardware-load-balancer.md) that describes the planning requirements for that topology.
