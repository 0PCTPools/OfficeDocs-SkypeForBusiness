# Configuring federation support for a Lync Online customer in Lync Server 2013
[]
You can provide communications services to users in your organization in any of the following ways: 
  
- Deploying Lync Server 2013 in your organization (known as on-premises services) and setting up Lync 2013 user accounts in your organization.
    
- Setting up a Microsoft Lync Online 2010 customer account with a Hosting Provider and setting up user accounts with the Hosting Provider (known as online services).
    
If you deploy Lync 2013 in your organization, you can federate with the domains of one or more Microsoft Lync Online 2010 customers. To enable federation between users of your on-premises Lync 2013 deployment and users of a Lync Online 2010 customer, you must configure support for the domain and users of the Lync Online customer.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This documentation describes only the procedures for configuring your organization to support federation with an Lync Online 2010 customer. This documentation does not describe the procedures for configuring the Lync Online 2010 customer to support federation.
