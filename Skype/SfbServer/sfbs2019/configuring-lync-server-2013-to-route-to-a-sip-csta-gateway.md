# Configuring Lync Server 2013 to route to a SIP/CSTA gateway
[]
A SIP/CSTA gateway is a gateway between SIP and a computer-supported telecommunications application (CSTA). A SIP/CSTA gateway provides the interface between an existing private branch exchange (PBX) and Lync Server for routing remote call control requests to the PBX. After you install a SIP/CSTA gateway, you must perform the following procedures on each Lync Server pool for which you want to configure remote call control:
  
- [Configure a static route for remote call control in Lync Server 2013](configure-a-static-route-for-remote-call-control.md)
    
- [Configure a trusted application entry for remote call control in Lync Server 2013](configure-a-trusted-application-entry-for-remote-call-control.md)
