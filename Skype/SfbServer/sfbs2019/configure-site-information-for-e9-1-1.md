# Configure site information for E9-1-1 in Lync Server 2013
[]
To define a location policy for subnets, you must do the following, in any order:
  
- Apply a location policy to the network site.
    
- Add the subnets to the network site.
    
For details about network sites, see [Lync Server sites for Lync Server 2013](sites.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you create network sites for another voice feature and you want to configure E9-1-1 by using the same sites, then you can modify the sites to be used for E9-1-1.
