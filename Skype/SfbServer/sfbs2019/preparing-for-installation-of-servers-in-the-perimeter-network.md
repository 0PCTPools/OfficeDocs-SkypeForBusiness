# Preparing for installation of servers in the perimeter network for Lync Server 2013
[]
Before you set up Edge Server components, you need to ensure that computers that you are setting up meet system requirements and complete other prerequisite steps required for deployment of Edge Server components.
  
Before you begin, review the details in the following topics in the Planning documentation for the reference architecture that you want to deploy:
  
- [Single consolidated edge with private IP addresses and NAT in Lync Server 2013](single-consolidated-edge-with-private-ip-addresses-and-nat.md)
    
- [Single consolidated edge with public IP addresses in Lync Server 2013](single-consolidated-edge-with-public-ip-addresses.md)
    
- [Scaled consolidated edge, DNS load balancing with private IP addresses using NAT in Lync Server 2013](scaled-consolidated-edge-dns-load-balancing-with-private-ip-addresses-using-nat.md)
    
- [Scaled consolidated edge, DNS load balancing with public IP addresses in Lync Server 2013](scaled-consolidated-edge-dns-load-balancing-with-public-ip-addresses.md)
    
- [Scaled consolidated edge with hardware load balancers in Lync Server 2013](scaled-consolidated-edge-with-hardware-load-balancers.md)
