# New caller ID feature in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 provides the administrator the flexibility to modify the format of the calling party's phone number. This Caller ID presentation feature enables the administrator to modify the calling party's phone number to a dialing format that is understood by the trunk peer, if necessary. For example, you can write a translation rule to remove +44 from the beginning of a dial string and replace it with 0144. 
  
Now, with Lync Server 2013, both the caller's phone number and the callee's phone number can be translated into different formats, as needed. This flexibility makes it possible for Lync Server 2013 to serve as a trunk translator between different telephony systems.
