# Edge Network (Planning Tool)
[]
Most Edge components are deployed in a perimeter network. The following components make up the Edge topology of the perimeter network. Except where noted, the components are part of [Scenarios for external user access in Lync Server 2013](scenarios-for-external-user-access.md) and are in the perimeter network. Edge components include the following: 
  
- Edge Server(s)
    
- Reverse proxy
    
- Firewall
    
- Directors (optional, and logically located on the internal network)
    
- Load balancing for Scaled Edge Topologies (either DNS load balancing or a hardware load balancer)
