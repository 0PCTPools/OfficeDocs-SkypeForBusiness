# Planning and deploying video in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 introduces the following new video features:
  
- **HD video** Users can experience resolutions up to full high definition (HD) (that is, 1920 x 1080) in two-party calls and multiparty conferences. 
    
- **Gallery View** In video conferences that have more than two people, users can see videos of participants in the conference. If the conference has more than five participants, video of only the most active participants appears in the top row, and a photo appears for the other participants. 
    
- **H.264 video** The H.264 video codec is now the default for encoding video on Lync 2013 clients. H.264 video supports a greater range of resolutions and frame rates, and improves video scalability. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Lync Server 2013 still supports the VC1 codec for interoperability with previous versions of Lync. For details and background information about the new video codec, see Jeff Schertz's Blog article, "Video Interoperability in Lync 2013," at [http://blog.schertz.name/2012/07/video-interoperability-in-lync-2013/](http://blog.schertz.name/2012/07/video-interoperability-in-lync-2013/). 
  
This section describes how to manage bandwidth for video in Lync Server 2013 and how to configure video features.
