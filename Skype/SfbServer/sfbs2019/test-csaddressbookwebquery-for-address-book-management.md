# Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery for Address Book management in Lync Server 2013
[]
Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery cmdlet: RTCUniversalServerAdmins. To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:
  
```
Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "Test-CsAddressBookService"}

```

Similar to the Test-CsAddressBookService synthetic transaction, Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery performs a query against the Address Book Web Query to ensure that it is operating properly. The cmdlet will connect to the Web Ticket authentication and present the credentials specified in -UserCredential. If authenticated, the cmdlet then present the -TargetSipAddress information. The cmdlet should report success if it was able to retrieve the information about the contact.
  
For example:
  
```
Test-CsAddressBookWebQuery -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.contoso.com -UserCredential contoso\bob -UserSipAddress "sip:bob@contoso.com" -TargetSipAddress "sip:bob@contoso.com"
```
