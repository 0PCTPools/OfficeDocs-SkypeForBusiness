# Configuring voice policies and PSTN usage records to authorize calling features and privileges in Lync Server 2013
[]
A voice policy enables a set of calling features and associates one or more PSTN usage records to define the calling features and permissions of users who are assigned the policy. 
  
Voice policy scope can be either Site (which defines the default features and permissions for a network site) or User (which defines the features and permissions to be assigned on a per-user or group basis). Users not assigned to a voice policy will automatically be assigned to the global policy, which is the default voice policy that is installed with the product.
