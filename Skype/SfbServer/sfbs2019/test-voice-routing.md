# Test voice routing in Lync Server 2013
[]
You can use the Lync Server Control Panel **Test Voice Routing** tab to configure test case scenarios. To define a test case, you specify the dial plan, voice policy, PSTN usage, and voice route against which to test a specified phone number. 
  
Before you actually deploy your voice routing configuration, we recommend that you test it on various phone numbers to make sure that the results are what you're expecting. 
  
> [!TIP]
> You can use the **Export test cases** and **Import test cases** commands to save voice routing test cases and import them for use on another computer. 
  
> [!CAUTION]
> If you delete any part of your voice routing configuration, such as a dial plan, voice policy, voice route, or phone usage, you should review and update your voice routing test cases. The Lync Server Control Panel will not alert you to test cases that are no longer valid due to changed configurations.
