[]
Lync Server 2013 can support meetings with up to 1000 participants using audio/video (A/V) conferencing, including sharing PowerPoint presentations. This support requires a dedicated pool configured to support large meetings and managed in a way that ensures hosting of only a single large meeting at a time. 
  
This section describes how to support large meetings using a dedicated Lync Server 2013 pool. It describes scalability considerations and the implementation requirements for a dedicated pool, including topology, hardware, software, and configuration requirements. It also provides a set of best practice recommendations for supporting large meetings, a summary of the test methods and results of server scalability testing conducted by the Lync Server engineering team, and the answers to frequently asked questions about support for large meetings.
