description: "The following topics outline the steps needed to merge your Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 pools to Microsoft Lync Server 2013 pools. First, you use the Topology Builder Merge wizard to merge topology information. This tool collects information about your Office Communications Server 2007 R2 environment, including Edge Server information, and publishes that information to a database shared with Lync Server 2013. After you publish the merged topology, Topology Builder is used to view the Office Communications Server 2007 R2 topology information and information about the newly deployed Lync Server 2013 topology. Finally, you use Lync Server Management Shell cmdlets to import policies and configuration settings."
