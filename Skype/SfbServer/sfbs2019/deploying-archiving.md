description: "Lync Server 2013 provides a solution for archiving instant messaging (IM) content and conferencing communications in Lync Server. You can implement archiving support by integrating archiving storage with Exchange 2013 storage, by using SQL Server databases for storage of Lync Server 2013 archiving data, or by using both Lync Server 2013 and Exchange 2013 storage. You control how data is archived using policies and archiving configurations.

# Deploying Archiving in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 provides a solution for archiving instant messaging (IM) content and conferencing communications in Lync Server. You can implement archiving support by integrating archiving storage with Exchange 2013 storage, by using SQL Server databases for storage of Lync Server 2013 archiving data, or by using both Lync Server 2013 and Exchange 2013 storage. You control how data is archived using policies and archiving configurations. For details, see [Planning for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](planning-for-archiving.md) in the Planning documentation and [How Archiving works in Lync Server 2013](how-archiving-works.md) in the Planning documentation, Deployment documentation, or Operations documentation. 
  
You can use the information in this section to set up and configure Archiving initially. After deployment, you can change Archiving settings. For details about how you implement archiving support for day-to-day management or to meet new requirements in your organization, see [Managing Lync Server 2013 Archiving](managing-lync-server-2013-archiving.md) in the Operations documentation.
