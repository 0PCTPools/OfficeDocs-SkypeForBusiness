# Client policies and settings in Lync Server 2013
[]
This topic provides an overview of the client-related settings and policies that you can configure in Lync Server 2013. Lync Server 2013 includes the following tools for managing and configuring clients: 
  
- **Lync Server 2013 Control Panel** A web-based graphical user interface for managing and configuring servers, users, clients, and devices. 
    
- **Lync Server Management Shell** A management interface with a rich set of Windows PowerShell command-line interface cmdlets and a number of pre-defined scripts. 
    
- **Lync 2013 Group Policy** A set of policies that you can configure for clients by using the Office Group Policy Administrative Template. Certain client bootstrapping policies must be configured before you deploy Lync 2013 clients. Other optional settings from Lync 2010 continue to be honored in Lync 2013. 
    
This section describes changes to client-related settings in Lync Server 2013.
