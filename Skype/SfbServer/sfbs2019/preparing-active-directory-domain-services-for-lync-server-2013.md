# Preparing Active Directory Domain Services for Lync Server 2013
[]
Before you deploy and operate Lync Server 2013, you must prepare Active Directory Domain Services by extending the schema and then creating and configuring objects. The schema extensions add the Active Directory classes and attributes that are required by Lync Server.
  
The topics in this section describe how to prepare AD DS for deploying Lync Server and how to assign setup and organizational unit (OU) permissions. For details about the schema changes required for Lync Server, see [Active Directory schema extensions, classes, and attributes used by Lync Server 2013](active-directory-schema-extensions-classes-and-attributes-used-by-lync-server-20.md).
