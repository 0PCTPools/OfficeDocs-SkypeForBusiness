# New IM and presence features in Lync Server 2013
[]
Microsoft Lync Server 2013 adds the following new instant messaging (IM) and presence features to enrich your users' Lync experience. 
  
- If your organization also runs Exchange 2013, users can take advantage of a unified contact store. Users can manage their contacts in Outlook 2013, Outlook Web App, as well as in Lync 2013.
    
- Your users can exchange instant messages and presence information with users of public IM providers that use Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, such as Google Talk, because of the **XMPP integration** feature of Lync Server 2013. XMPP integration built into Front End Servers and Edge Servers, and you can enable it and configure it to allow this feature.
