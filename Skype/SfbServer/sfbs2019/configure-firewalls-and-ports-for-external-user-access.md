# Configure firewalls and ports for external user access in Lync Server 2013
[]
To configure firewalls and ports, you need to configure them for Edge Servers, reverse proxy servers, and possibly hardware load balancers (for a scaled deployment that does not use DNS load balancing). This section provides information about firewall and port requirements for all Edge Server components and the configuration of firewall ports for Edge Servers. For details about configuring ports for reverse proxy servers, see [Setting up reverse proxy servers for Lync Server 2013](setting-up-reverse-proxy-servers.md). If you are deploying a scaled edge topology and are using hardware load balancing instead of DNS load balancing, see [Scaled consolidated edge with hardware load balancers in Lync Server 2013](scaled-consolidated-edge-with-hardware-load-balancers.md) in the Planning documentation for details about configuring ports for hardware load balancers.
