# Associate subnets with network sites for E9-1-1 in Lync Server 2013
[]
Every subnet in your network that you want to enable for E9-1-1 must be associated with a specific network site. This is because subnet information is used to determine the network site on which an endpoint is located. 
  
E9-1-1 does not have any special requirements for associating subnets with network sites. To create an association between the subnets and network sites in your topology, follow the procedures in [Associate a subnet with a network site in Lync Server 2013](associate-a-subnet-with-a-network-site.md).
