# Disable-CsComputer
[]
 **In this article**
  
[Examples](#sectionSection0)
  
[Detailed Description](#sectionSection1)
  
[Input Types](#sectionSection2)
  
[Return Types](#sectionSection3)
  
Disables a service or server role that has been removed from a computer running Lync Server. This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2010.
  
```
Disable-CsComputer [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-Force <SwitchParameter>] [-GlobalCatalog <Fqdn>] [-GlobalSettingsDomainController <Fqdn>] [-Report <String>] [-Scorch <SwitchParameter>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]
```

## Examples
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

### EXAMPLE 1

The command shown in Example 1 disables the local computer.
  
```
Disable-CsComputer 
```

### EXAMPLE 2

The command shown in Examples 2 also disables the local computer. In addition to disabling the computer, however, this command records information about the success (or failure) of that task in the file C:\Logs\Disable.html. This log file is generated by adding the Report parameter followed by the path to the log file where you want the information recorded.
  
```
Disable-CsComputer -Report C:\Logs\Disable.html
```

## Detailed Description
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Removing a service or server role from a computer does not automatically update the Lync Server topology. Instead, that service or role must be disabled before the changes are fully updated in the topology. The **Disable-CsComputer** cmdlet provides a way for administrators to disable any services or server roles that have been removed from the local computer. 
  
Unless you use the Scorch parameter, the **Disable-CsComputer** cmdlet does not uninstall the Lync Server software; instead, it simply stops the computer from functioning in its previously assigned role. 
  
Who can run this cmdlet: You must be a local administrator and a member of the domain in order to run the **Disable-CsComputer** cmdlet locally.
