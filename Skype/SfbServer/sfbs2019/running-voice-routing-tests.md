description: "Lync Server 2013 provides two different methods for testing voice routes: you can do informal, ad hoc testing against any phone number and any voice route; or you can do more formal testing using voice route test cases. With formal testing, you define such things as the number to be dialed and the dial plan and voice policy to be employed, and Lync Server can then verify that that, given those conditions, the supplied number can successfully be routed to the PSTN network. Both of these methods are described in subsequent sections of this documentation."

# Running voice routing tests in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 provides two different methods for testing voice routes: you can do informal, ad hoc testing against any phone number and any voice route; or you can do more formal testing using voice route test cases. With formal testing, you define such things as the number to be dialed and the dial plan and voice policy to be employed, and Lync Server can then verify that that, given those conditions, the supplied number can successfully be routed to the PSTN network. Both of these methods are described in subsequent sections of this documentation.
