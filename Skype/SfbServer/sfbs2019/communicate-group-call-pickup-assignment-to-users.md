[]
After you enable Group Call Pickup for users, use email or some other mechanism to notify users of their call pickup group number. Notify users of the call pickup group number for any group that they might want to monitor. Because users can retrieve calls for other users even if they are not in the same group, users might need the call pickup group number for multiple groups.
