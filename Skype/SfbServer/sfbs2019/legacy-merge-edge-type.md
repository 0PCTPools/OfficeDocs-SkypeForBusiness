# Legacy Merge Edge Type
[]
Depending on your scaling needs, in Office Communications Server 2007 R2 you had the option of configuring an Edge Server in the following configurations:
  
- **Single Edge Server**
    
- **Load-balanced consolidated Edge**
    
- **Expanded Edge**
    
> [!NOTE]
> Office Communications Server 2007 R2 supported deployment of the expanded configuration only from the command line. 
  
For a **Single Edge Server** or **Load-balanced consolidated Edge** server, click **Next** to specify configuration information. For an **Expanded Edge**, each server's configuration must be changed to a consolidated Edge configuration before it can be merged with Lync Server 2013.
