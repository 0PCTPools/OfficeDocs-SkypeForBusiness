# Overview of Lync Server 2013 hybrid deployments
[]
A Lync Server hybrid deployment is a deployment where users of a domain, such as contoso.com, are split between using Lync Server on-premises and Skype for Business Online. Some of the domain users are homed on the on-premises Lync Server, and some users are homed in Skype for Business Online.
  
You can configure your on-premises Lync deployment for hybrid with Skype for Business Online and use Active Directory Synchronization to keep your on-premises and online users synchronized. You can also configure hybrid deployments for integration with on-premises Exchange and SharePoint, or with Microsoft Office 365 applications, including Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.
  
This section guides you through deploying the applications required for a Lync Server hybrid deployment, and then configuring your deployment to manage users between Lync Server on-premises and Skype for Business Online.
  
For information about configuring your on-premises Lync Server deployment for hybrid with Skype for Business Online see the following topics:
