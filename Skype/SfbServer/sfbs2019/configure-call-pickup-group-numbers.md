# Configure call pickup group numbers in Lync Server 2013
[]
Group Call Pickup is based on the Call Park application. When you deploy Group Call Pickup, you configure the call park orbit table with ranges of phone numbers that are designated as call pickup group numbers. These group numbers are the numbers that users dial to pick up calls that are ringing for another user.
  
Like call park orbit numbers, call pickup group numbers need to be virtual extensions that have no user or phone assigned to them. Each Front End pool where you deploy Group Call Pickup can have one or more ranges of call pickup group numbers. The group number ranges must be globally unique across the Lync Server deployment.
