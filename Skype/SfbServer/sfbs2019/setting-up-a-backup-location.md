description: "Before you take your first backup of Lync Server, set up the hardware and software that you need in order to store and maintain the backups. You need to obtain access to the media and content, as appropriate, and provide network connectivity between each server to be backed up and the backup media. The media and location that you use should be defined in your backup and restoration strategy. The location that you use for regular backups can be local or remote, but it must be secure, and it must be accessible for both backup and restoration. We recommend using a remote location to protect against a catastrophic event at your primary site."

# Setting up a backup location for Lync Server 2013
[]
Before you take your first backup of Lync Server, set up the hardware and software that you need in order to store and maintain the backups. You need to obtain access to the media and content, as appropriate, and provide network connectivity between each server to be backed up and the backup media. The media and location that you use should be defined in your backup and restoration strategy. The location that you use for regular backups can be local or remote, but it must be secure, and it must be accessible for both backup and restoration. We recommend using a remote location to protect against a catastrophic event at your primary site.
  
After you set up and test the individual components, verify accessibility to the backups from each server.
