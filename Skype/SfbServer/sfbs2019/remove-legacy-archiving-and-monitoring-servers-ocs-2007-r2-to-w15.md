# Remove legacy Archiving and Monitoring servers [OCS 2007 R2 to W15]
[]
If your Office Communications Server 2007 R2 deployment contained an Archiving Server or a Monitoring Server, after migrating to Lync Server 2013, those servers can be removed from the legacy environment provided all users have been removed from any remaining Office Communications Server 2007 R2 pools. You can remove the Archiving Server or Monitoring Server in any sequence. The key requirement is that all users have been removed from any remaining Office Communications Server 2007 R2 pools.
  
You can move users from Office Communications Server 2007 R2 to Lync Server 2013 by following the procedures outlined in [Phase 6: Move users to the pilot pool [OCS 2007 R2 to W15]](phase-6-move-users-to-the-pilot-pool-ocs-2007-r2-to-w15.md).
  
After you have confirmed that all users have been removed from any remaining pools, follow the procedure in "Removing Servers and Server Roles" at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=205887](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=205887).
