# Associate Front End With Edge
[]
Each Front End pool can have only one Edge Server or Edge pool associated with it. When you enable external user access for a site, you can provide support for remote users. You can also enable support for federated users, which can include support for users of specific public instant messaging (IM) connectivity providers (such as Windows Live, Yahoo!, and AOL), and support for anonymous users.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  As of September 1st, 2012, the Microsoft Lync Public IM Connectivity User Subscription License ("PIC USL") is no longer available for purchase for new or renewing agreements. Customers with active licenses will be able to continue to federate with Yahoo! Messenger until the service shut down date. An end of life date of June 2014 for AOL and Yahoo! has been announced. For details, see [Support for public instant messenger connectivity in Lync Server 2013](support-for-public-instant-messenger-connectivity.md). >  The PIC USL is a per-user per-month subscription license that is required for Lync Server or Office Communications Server to federate with Yahoo! Messenger. Microsoft's ability to provide this service has been contingent upon support from Yahoo!, the underlying agreement for which is winding down. >  More than ever, Lync is a powerful tool for connecting across organizations and with individuals around the world. Federation with Windows Live Messenger requires no additional user/device licenses beyond the Lync Standard CAL. Skype federation will be added to this list, enabling Lync users to reach hundreds of millions of people with IM and voice. 
  
All pools at a site, and the pools of multiple central sites, can use the same Edge Server, if usage does not exceed the capacity of the Edge Server. For details about monitoring, including scaling, see [Planning for external user access in Lync Server 2013](planning-for-external-user-access.md) in the Planning documentation. For details about designing a topology to support external user access, see [Define your edge topology in Lync Server 2013](define-your-edge-topology.md) in the Deployment documentation.
