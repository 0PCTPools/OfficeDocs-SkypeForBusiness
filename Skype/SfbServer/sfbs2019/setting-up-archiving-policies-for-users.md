# Setting up Archiving policies for users in Lync Server 2013
[]
You can enable or disable Archiving for specific users by creating and configuring an Archiving policy for users, and then applying the policy to specific users or user groups. User policies override any global policy or site policies. Archiving policies only apply if you do not use Microsoft Exchange integration or, if you do use Microsoft Exchange integration, but have some users who are not homed on Exchange 2013 and have their mailboxes put on In-Place Hold.
  
For details about how Archiving policies work, including the hierarchy for global, site, and user policies, see [How Archiving works in Lync Server 2013](how-archiving-works.md) Planning documentation, Deployment documentation, or Operations documentation. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you enable Microsoft Exchange integration for your deployment, Exchange In-Place Hold policies control whether archiving is enabled for the users who are homed on Exchange 2013 and have their mailboxes put on In-Place Hold. For details, see [Setting up policies for Archiving in Lync Server 2013 when using Exchange Server integration](setting-up-policies-for-archiving-when-using-exchange-server-integration.md) in the Deployment documentation. > You should specify all appropriate options in the Archiving configurations before enabling Archiving of internal or external communications in the Archiving policies. For details, see [Configuring Archiving options in Lync Server 2013](configuring-archiving-options.md) in the Deployment documentation.
