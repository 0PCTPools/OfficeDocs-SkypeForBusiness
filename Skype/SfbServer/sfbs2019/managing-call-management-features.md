# Managing call management features in Lync Server 2013
[]
Enterprise Voice call management features control how incoming calls are routed and answered. Lync Server 2013 provides the following call management features: 
  
- **Call Park**: Enables voice users to temporarily park a call and then pick it up from the same phone or another phone.
    
- **Group Pickup**: Enables users to pick up calls that are ringing for other users by dialing a call pickup group number.
    
- **Response Group**: Routes incoming calls to groups of agents by using hunt groups or interactive voice response (IVR) questions and answers.
    
- **Announcement**: Plays a message for calls made to an unassigned number, or routes the call elsewhere, or both.
    
This section describes how to manage these call management features in your Enterprise Voice deployment.
