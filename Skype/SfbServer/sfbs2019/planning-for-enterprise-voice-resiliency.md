description: "Voice resiliency refers to the ability of users to continue making and receiving calls if a central site that hosts Lync Server 2013 becomes unavailable, whether through a wide area network (WAN) failure or another cause. If a central site fails, Enterprise Voice service must continue uninterrupted through seamless failover to a backup site. In the event of WAN failure, branch site calls must be redirected to a local PSTN gateway. This section discusses planning for voice resiliency in the event of central-site or WAN failure."

# Planning for Enterprise Voice resiliency in Lync Server 2013
[]
Voice resiliency refers to the ability of users to continue making and receiving calls if a central site that hosts Lync Server 2013 becomes unavailable, whether through a wide area network (WAN) failure or another cause. If a central site fails, Enterprise Voice service must continue uninterrupted through seamless failover to a backup site. In the event of WAN failure, branch site calls must be redirected to a local PSTN gateway. This section discusses planning for voice resiliency in the event of central-site or WAN failure.
