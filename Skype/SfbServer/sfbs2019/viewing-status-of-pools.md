# Viewing status of pools in Lync Server 2013
[]
For each Enterprise Pool and the pool of each Standard Edition Server, you can view information about pool status and the status of other components used by the pool through the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel. We recommended implementing System Center Operations Manager 2012 with the Lync Server Control Panel to help administrators in viewing the health of pools within their environment.
  
### View pools

1. Using the Lync Server Control Panel, open the Lync Server Control Panel.
    
2. Click Topology, and check status of all servers in the Topology.
