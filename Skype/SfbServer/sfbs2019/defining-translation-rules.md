# Defining translation rules in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 Enterprise Voice routes calls based on phone numbers normalized to E.164 format. This means that all dialed strings must be normalized to E.164 format for the purpose of performing reverse number lookup (RNL) so they can be translated to their matching SIP URI. Lync Server 2013 provides the ability to manipulate the called ID and the caller ID presentation. 
  
This section discusses how to manipulate the called ID and caller ID.
