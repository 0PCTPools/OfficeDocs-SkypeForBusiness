# Migrate Lync Room System (LRS) devices to Skype Room System v2 
Lync Room System (LRS) devices with Skype Room System Version 1 (SRS v1) software will reach [end of support on October 9, 2018](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043450/products-reaching-end-of-support-for-2018). This means Skype Room Systems v1 software will not get any product updates or fixes after this date. Customers with Lync Room System devices using Skype Room System v1 software are advised to upgrade their devices to Skype Room System version 2 (SRS v2).

Skype Room System Version 2 (SRS v2) software works with Microsoft Teams in addition to Skype for Business Server and Online services for meetings and calling on all SRS v2 supported devices.

Your existing devices **may** continue to work after the end of Skype Room System v1 software suppor until this software hits a software bug that needs Microsoft to release a fix, or may have a case where an existing communication protocol used by Skype Room System v1 software changes or is no longer supported. One such known change is deprecation of TLS 1.0/ 1.1 in Microsoft Office 365. You can learn more about [Preparing for TLS 1.0/1.1 Deprecation](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Blog/Preparing-for-TLS-1-0-1-1-Deprecation-O365-Skype-for-Business/bc-p/223608).
