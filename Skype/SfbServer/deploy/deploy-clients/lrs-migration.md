# Migrate Lync Room System devices to Skype Room System V2 
Lync Room System (LRS) devices with Skype Room System Version 1 (SRS v1) software are coming to end of support on October 9, 2018. This means Skype Room Systems software will not get any product updates or fixes after this date. Customers with Lync Room System devices with Skype Room System V1 software are advised to upgrade their devices to Skype Room System Version 2 (SRS v2). 
Skype Room System Version 2 (SRS v2) software also enables Microsoft Teams in addition to Skype server and online services for meetings on these devices. 

Your existing devices **may** continue to work after end of SRS V1 software support until it hits a software bug that needs Microsoft to release a fix or existing communication protocols as used by SRS v1 changes or no longer work. One such known change is deprecation of TLS 1.0/ 1.1 in Office 365. You can learn more about TLS 1.0/1.1 deprecation [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Blog/Preparing-for-TLS-1-0-1-1-Deprecation-O365-Skype-for-Business/bc-p/223608).
