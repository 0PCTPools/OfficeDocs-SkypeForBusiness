is a great resource to find out more about Skype Room Systems v2 and how it can
add value as part of your Skype for Business deployment. in addition, we
recommend watching this [overview video](https://youtu.be/tNey5KZVCl0).

## Skype Room Systems v2 components 

Skype Room Systems v2 includes the following key components to deliver a great
user experience:

-   Touchscreen control panel

-   Compute

-   Skype Room Systems application

-   Dock / Extender

-   Peripheral devices (camera, microphone, speaker)

-   External screens (maximum of two)

-   HDMI input

You can procure these components as preinstalled bundles from a number of
vendors, or you can purchase the components individually by following the
[requirements documented in this
article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/clients-and-devices/requirements).

In addition to the Surface Pro/dock combination, you can also purchase Skype
Room Systems v2 units which have the touchscreen control panel, processing unit,
dock, and key peripheral devices integrated into one unit.

Typically, the bundles and integrated units include preinstalled software,
whereas if you buy components individually for the Surface Pro systems, you’ll
need to install the software. For instructions, see LINK TO Device software
installation.

You can deploy Skype Room Systems v2 with Skype for Business Online, or Skype
for Business hybrid or on-premises deployments.

| Decision points | Will you deploy Skype Room Systems v2 in your organization? |

-   How will you procure your Skype Room Systems v2 systems—bundled, as separate
    components, or as an integrated unit?

| Next steps | Review the meeting rooms you have (and plan to set up) to understand where you want to deploy Skype Room Systems v2 systems and the peripheral devices that would be appropriate for the room size. |   |

## Room inventory and capability planning

Use the approach illustrated below to guide you through your deployment, and
customize the sample outputs provided throughout this article as needed for your
organization.

![](media/96dd47f72facc84d1a1c5ce580d4e7d1.png)

The first step is to inventory your organization’s existing meeting and
conference rooms to understand their environment, room size, layout, and
purpose, and to identify the capabilities you want each room in scope to have in
the future.

After you create an inventory of the equipment and capabilities in each existing
room, your requirements for that room feed into your device selection planning
to create a rich conferencing solution. The modalities (audio, video) needed for
each room—in addition to room size and purpose—all play an important role in
deciding which solution is most appropriate for each room.

As part of your discovery, it’s key to consider room acoustics and layout. For
example, check that the chairs in the room won’t block the camera view. Verify
that the room doesn’t have excessive echo or noisy air conditioning, and that it
does have sufficient power for the screens and Skype Room Systems devices. There
are many factors to consider that your audio-visual (AV) team or partner will be
able to advise on.

| Decision points | Which sites are in scope for your deployment? |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|


-   Which rooms are in scope for this deployment?

    -   Who will undertake the meeting rooms inventory?

| Next steps | Review the rooms in scope, and configure Skype Room Systems for them. |   |   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|


Sample meeting/conference room inventory

| **Site**  | **Room Name** | **Room Type** | **Number of People**  | **In Scope** | **Current room capabilities**       | **Future Room Capabilities**                             |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| London HQ | Curie         | Medium        | 6-12                  | Yes          | Speakerphone                        | 1 Screens, audio and video plus presentation PSTN Access |
| Sydney HQ | Hill          | Large         | 12-16                 | Yes          | Legacy AV unit, 1 screen and camera | 2 Screens, audio and video plus presentation PSTN Access |

**Pro Tip** – If you have many sites to inventory, you might want to download
and use the [Site Rollout and Migration Planning - Site
Questionnaire](https://myadvisor.fasttrack.microsoft.com/CloudVoice/Downloads?SelectedIDs=5_1_0_15).

## Device selection 

Evaluate which Skype Room Systems v2 solution is the most suitable for each room
based on the future capabilities you want for the room. Decide which AV
peripheral devices are the best fit, depending on room size and layout.

For guidance for the type of system and peripheral devices by room type and
size, see the [Skype Room Systems v2
requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/clients-and-devices/requirements)
article.

Based on the vendor you prefer, use the information provided in the article to
define your Skype Room Systems system and supported peripheral device
configuration per room type, and use this as a template for your deployment.

**Pro Tip** – Some room types might not be applicable for your deployment.

| Decision points | From your inventory, which types of rooms are in scope for your deployment? |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|


-   Which systems will you deploy for each room type?

| Next steps | Start to gather key operational material for your chosen systems, and engage your procurement team. |   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|


Sample Skype Room Systems deployment template for your organization

| **Room Type / Size** | **Number of People**  | Skype Room Systems v**2 System** | **Peripheral devices**  | **Display (s)** |
|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Focus 10’ by 9’      | 2-4                   |                                  |                         |                 |
| Small 16’ by 16’     | 4-6                   |                                  |                         |                 |
| Medium 18’ by 20’    | 6-12                  |                                  |                         |                 |
| Large 15’ by 20’     | 12-16                 |                                  |                         |                 |

**Pro Tip –** Now is a great time to start gathering information about the Skype
Room Systems v2 solution you’ve chosen. We recommend that you work with your
vendor to discuss completing the design template to capture information that
will be relevant to your deployment; you can [download this handy
template](https://myadvisor.fasttrack.microsoft.com/CloudVoice/Downloads?SelectedIDs=4_4_0_11)
from MyAdvisor.

## Procurement 

You can procure your chosen system as a bundle, separate components, or an
integrated solution via device partners. Or, you can acquire a partner device
dock and prepare your own Skype Room Systems solution by using Surface Pro and
existing, supported AV peripheral devices.

You can acquire devices from a number of partners who are listed in the
[requirements
article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/clients-and-devices/requirements).
Please visit the device partners’ websites to learn more about these solutions
and procurement options.

Depending on your deployment scale and approach, you might decide to have the
devices and peripheral devices shipped to a central location for initial
configuration and assignment. This might be a good approach for a staged rollout
across many sites. Or, you might choose to ship the bundles directly to your
sites.

| Decision points | Will you ship the components directly to a site or to a staging facility? |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|


-   Who will manage the staging facility (if you decide to use one)?

| Next steps | Confirm that your sites are ready. |   |
|------------|------------------------------------|---|
