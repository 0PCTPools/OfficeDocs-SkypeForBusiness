			<p>Workstreampeople envisions with Anywhere365 that a contact center is no longer a physical &quot;switchboard&quot; entity where incoming calls are manually routed to persons within an organization, but a transparent technology that acts as a natural extension to people's intuitive way of engaging with others.</p>
			<p>Since we believe that anybody could be a contact center, the reception is a role model of a contact center. For that reason we developed a reception attendant console from a user friendly perspective, and support all features that reception needs, queue, visual transfers, drag/drop, and swipe or touch (Windows tablet version). Furthermore it offers Exchange calendar integration for availability. Also transfers can be made to groups (UCC's) in order to make, 'functional transfers' possible if the Anywhere365 UCC platform is available for departments and functional groups.</p>
			<p>Available now in 8 languages, e.g. English, Dutch, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish and Swedish.</p>
