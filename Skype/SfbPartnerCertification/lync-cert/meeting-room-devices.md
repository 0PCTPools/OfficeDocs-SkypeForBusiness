## Meeting room devices and solutions
Microsoft tests and qualifies meeting room solutions for Lync under the [Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program (UCOIP)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788948) <!-- note that these are technet topic links and will have to change --> and [Compatible Devices Program](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788951#compatible_devices). Meeting room solutions optimized for Lync offer high-quality audio and video and reduce the need to set up and troubleshoot equipment.

- IP conference phones
- USB speakerphones designed for conference rooms
- Video conferencing devices

## Video Solutions Qualified for Lync

Microsoft tests and qualifies video teleconference systems (VTCs), multipoint control unit (MCUs) or conferencing bridges, and gateways for interoperability with Lync through our [Video Interoperability Program](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788951#video_interop). Our Video Interoperability program tests:

- **Video endpoints** enable direct registration as an end point on Office Communications Server 2007 R2 and Lync Server.
- **Video infrastructure** to enable multipoint video conference bridge with Lync users and enable standards based VTCs to connect via a gateway.

Always check if your Lync version was tested to interoperate with the video systems.
