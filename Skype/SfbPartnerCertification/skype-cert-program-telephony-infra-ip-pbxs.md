These devices have not gone through the formal certification program nor was testing requested by the vendor. These configurations utilize the commercially available production SIP trunk interface of the IP-PBX vendor but may not be supported by the IP-PBX vendor. In addition, IP-PBX vendor-provided complete documentation for installation and set-up, release notes, or documented support processes may not be available. Wherever possible, Microsoft will endeavor to provide documentation for installation and set-up.

All IP PBXs tested with Lync Server 2013 are forward compatible and supported with Skype for Business 2015. See [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788945) for a list of Lync Server 2013 supported and qualified IP-PBXs.
