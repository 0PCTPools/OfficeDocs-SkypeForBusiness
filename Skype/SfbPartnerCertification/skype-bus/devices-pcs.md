# PCs
The PCs program ensures that workers can use their PCs as their complete unified communications endpoint. PCs empower workers to use all the tools and features of the platform without the need of any USB peripheral. Form factors tested include, all-in-one desktops, convertible tablets, laptops and monitors*.

All of these form factors are tested to deliver:
- High-definition audio and optimal speaker and mic placement for conference calls.
- Rich, crisp video, at a variety of resolutions, and with a wide field of view, so that video conferencing is easier and more useful.

All of these criteria apply equally for Skype for Business as they do for Lync 2013, therefore all PCs that are qualified for Lync 2013 are also Certified for Skype for Business

[Note]
Monitors require an embedded camera and embedded speakerphone, both passing Lync Logo specs (including USB HID support). The display is not tested.
