# Skype for Business certification program

The **Skype for Business Certification Program** is designed to offer Microsoft customers badges or designations as indicators of third party solutions that demonstrate a high quality experience and compatibility when used with **Skype for Business**.

There are two certification levels, each having different specification requirements.
1. Certified for Skype for Business
    Certified for Skype for Business is the designation for products that meet the most stringent specifications outlined in the program.
    Following successful completion and pass of the specifications, products will be deemed "Certified for Skype for Business."
 
2. Works with Skype for Business
    Works with Skype for Business is the designation for products that meet the minimum specifications outlined in the program. 
    Following successful completion and test pass of the specifications, products will be deemed "Works with Skype for Business."

Only products that successfully pass the certification tests outlined in the Skype for Business Certification Program receive their respective designation.
Specifications apply to each category based on, but not exclusive to, industry standards, enterprise class solutions, functional interoperablity or audio and video quality. All vendors participating in Skype for Business Certification Program have a premiere support contract or equivalent benefit for rapid resolution of support tickets.

If you are a vendor seeking to join the certification program, see [How to Join](how-to-join.md) for requirements and available programs.
