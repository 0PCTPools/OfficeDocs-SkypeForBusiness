# USB audio and video devices
The USB certification program ensures that USB peripherals such as headsets, speakerphones, webcams, and monitors, offer rich audio or video quality. Supporting plug & play features with Lync and Skype for Business clients, passing products provide a great experience for end-users and administrators.

> [!NOTE]
> All Skype for Business certified devices will work with Microsoft Teams, but they will not be given Teams certification until they meet new requirements. More information about Teams certification will be available in early 2019.

## End-User Experience
- Automatic selection of default audio device and prioritization if multiple audio peripherals are present
- Plug and play: once connected, a device registers on the Skype for Business client and is ready to use
- Basic call control across PC and devices with answer/hang-up, mute/unmute, and volume control.
- Audio quality (embedded in the device): no echo or excessive glitches, echo cancellation across devices, wideband audio
- Video quality: Noise, color, image detail, jitter, latency, frame rate, field of view

## Administrator Experience
- Firmware and fixes remote software update and contractual SLA for hardware updates
- Full outline of [test specifications and tools](test-spec.md) 

All of these specifications apply equally for Lync 2013 as they do for Skype for Business, hence all USB peripherals that are qualified for Lync 2013 are also certified for Skype for Business.
