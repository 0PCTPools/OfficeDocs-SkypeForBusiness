# IP Phones
Microsoft plans to test and certify IP phones for Skype for Business through the Skype for Business Certification Program. This reflects an evolution from the previous basic interop compatibility ("Compatible with Lync‚Äù) to a higher quality bar, including metrics targeting higher reliability. Phone vendors are actively working to meet this higher bar and will be qualifying against the new requirements starting the end of this calendar year. In addition, our partners are currently working to provide support for the Skype for Business Online service that will be released later this year.

In the meantime, Skype for Business Server supports backwards compatibility with all of our Lync qualified IP phones, and devices which are supported for Skype for Business Online will be announced as soon as they are qualified.

Find details of our [qualified IP Phones](../lync-cert/ip-phones.md).
