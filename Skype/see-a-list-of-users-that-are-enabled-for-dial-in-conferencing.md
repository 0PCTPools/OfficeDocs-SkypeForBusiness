# See a list of users that are enabled for dial-in conferencing

After you have enabled users in your organization for dial-in conferencing, you can view the list of those users who have been enabled. When you look at the list, you will also see for each user in the list the type of dial-in conferencing provider that they are using, the default dial-in phone number for the user and if you organization isn't enabled for dynamic conference IDs, the static conference IDs for dial-in meetings that they organize.
  
    
    


## Viewing a list of users


1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
  
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
  
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation go to **Dial-in conferencing**> and then **Dial-in users**.
    
  

## What else should I know?


- When you view the list of users that are enabled, you can select a user from the list and use the Action pane to edit the dial-in conferencing settings for that user.
    
  
- When you select a single user that is configured to use Microsoft as the dial-in conferencing provider you can view the default phone number and if you organization isn't enabled for dynamic conference IDs, reset the conference ID for meetings that the user organizes.
    
  
- When you select a single user that is configured to use a third-party dial-in conferencing provider, you can view the name of the dial-in conferencing provider, the toll phone number and the toll-free phone number (if they are set up).
    
  
- You can use the filter options to show users that have:
    
  - **Dial-in conferencing on**
    
  
  - **Dial-in conferencing off**
    
  
  - **Conferencing provider - Microsoft**
    
  
  - **Conferencing provider - others**
    
  
- You can use the search button to search for an individual user in the list.
    
  
- You can select more than one user and do the following:
    
  - Select a different default number for these users.
    
  
  - Turn off dial-in conferencing for the user by selecting the provider to **None**.
    
  
  - Switch to Microsoft as the dial-in conferencing provider if the user has been assigned a **Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing** license.
    
  
  - Allow/disallow anonymous users to activate the selected users' phone meetings.
