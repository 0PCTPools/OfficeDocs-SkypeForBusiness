# Assign a phone number in Skype for Business

When you set up PSTN Calling, you assign phone numbers to your users. The phone number you assign will be listed in the **This Work Phone** box in their Skype for Business client and can't be changed by a user.

## Assigning a number

When you are setting up users so they can make and receive phone calls, you must first use the Skype for Business admin center and assign a phone number but you can change or remove the phone number if you need to.

> [!NOTE]
> One way to see if a user has a license assigned is in the **Skype for Business admin center** > **Voice** > **Voice users** and select the user. If a license is assigned, it will be listed under the **Assigned license**. You can use the Office 365 admin center though too. 
  
    
    

 **Assign a phone number to a user**
  
    
    

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

3. In the left navigation, **Voice** > **Voice users**.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Skype for Business Cloud PBX** add-on license, or one **Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing** add-on license.
    
  
4. On the **Voice users** page, locate and select the user or users that you want to assign a phone number to.
    
  
5. In the Action pane, click **Assign number**.
    
  
6. On the **Assign number** page in the **Select number to assign** list, then select the phone number for the user.
    
    > [!TIP]
      > If you don't see any phone numbers listed, you need to go  [Getting Skype for Business phone numbers for your users](getting-skype-for-business-phone-numbers-for-your-users.md) first or If you use the **Skype for Business admin center** > **Voice** > **Phone numbers** page > click **Add** then **New user numbers**. 
7. To assign or change the associated emergency address under **Select validated emergency location**, either select the location from the list or if you have many locations defined put the name of the city in the **Search by city** box and click **Search**.
    
  
8. After you pick the phone number and emergency location, click **Save**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
      > Because of the latency between Office 365 and Skype for Business Online, it can possibly take up to 24 hours for user to be enabled. If after 24 hours, the phone number isn't assigned correctly, please  [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b%28Office.14%29.aspx).
