# What is my billing telephone number?

The billing telephone number (BTN) is the main phone number that is included on your bill and billed by your service provider or carrier. If you are transferring a phone number from an account that has only one phone number, you will need to put this phone number in. If you are transferring phone numbers from an account that has more than one, you can look at your bill or contact your service provider or carrier to determine what the billing telephone number is for your account.
