The default system greeting is something like "Please leave a message for John Smith. After the tone, please record your message. When you finish recording hang-up or press the pound key for more options." 
  
    
    

 **First, read this important info:**

    > [!NOTE]
      > Users can change their own greeting language through their settings after they sign in to the Office 365 portal.
