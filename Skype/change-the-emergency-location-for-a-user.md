# Change the emergency location for a user

Each active phone number must have an emergency address - either associated when you get a phone number in Office 365 or transfer a phone number - when the phone number is assigned to the user. When you associate the number to an emergency address, you can also add an emergency location to give a more exact location within a physical location. An emergency location can be the floor, building wing, or office number where the user is located. You can have an unlimited number of locations for a given emergency address, and can change the emergency location if the user moves to a different office or buildingâ€”for example, if the user moves from floor 34 to floor 35.
