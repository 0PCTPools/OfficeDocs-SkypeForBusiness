# Skype for Business Online support in Outlook on the web

Outlook on the web (Outlook Web App) in Office 365 offers a basic Skype for Business web client from the navigation bar. This basic client is available for Online users who's admin hasn't configured a vanity URL for their Office 365 organization. As long as the user's account is online and doesn't have a vanity URL they will still see the experience even if their organization has some user accounts that are homed on-premises. Those users that have user accounts on-premises (whether they have a vanity url or not) or if they are managed by Microsoft will see the Lync experience in the Outlook web app.
  
    
    

The following table helps to summarize the different set ups that you may have and what web client will be used:
