## Required Software Downloads

You will need the following downloads to build your own Skype Room Systems v2 image:
  
    
    

- The  [Skype Room Systems v2 installation package](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=851168).
    
  
- Obtain a copy of the 64-bit version of Windows 10 Enterprise Anniversary edition (English language, build 1607). 
    
  
- The supported  [Surface Pro 4 drivers](http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/a/c/6acb37c4-e4c1-4e0e-bbae-ac7a0c303593/SurfacePro4_Win10_1701001_0.zip).
    
  

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 10 Enterprise Creators Update (build 1703) is not supported for Skype Room Systems v2 image creation. 
  
    
    

These downloads need to be combined into a bootable Windows installation media disk in a specific way, described further in  [Configure a Skype Room Systems v2 console](configure-a-skype-room-systems-v2-console.md). 
  
    
    
In addition, you will probably want a copy of the  [Powershell script](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/0/D/90D4826A-9FD2-47D2-B911-97BF1737F4F7/SkypeRoomProvisioningScript.ps1.txt) used to provision Skype Room Systems v2 accounts.
