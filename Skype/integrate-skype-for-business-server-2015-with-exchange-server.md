# Integrate Skype for Business Server 2015 with Exchange Server
[] **Summary:** Review integration steps for Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013 and Skype for Business Server 2015.
Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013 and Skype for Business Server 2015 are compatible and integrate well. For example, Skype for Business user presence information can be reported in Microsoft Outlook; likewise, Skype for Business can access a user's Outlook calendar, notice the user has a meeting scheduled, and show the user's presence as Busy during the meeting. Although you do not have to run Exchange Server in order to run Skype for Business Server (or vice-versa) the two products together enhance each other's user experience.
