# Test-CsReplica
[]
Verifies the status of the replica service on the local computer. The replica service is used to replicate information among all the Skype for Business Server 2015 computers in your topology. This cmdlet was introduced in Lync Server 2013.
  
    
    


```

Test-CsReplica [-GlobalCatalog <Fqdn>] [-GlobalSettingsDomainController <Fqdn>] [-Report <String>]

```


## Examples
<a name="Examples"> </a>


### Example 1

The command shown in Example 1 tests the Skype for Business Server 2015 replica service on the local computer. In this example the Verbose parameter is used to ensure that information about the test - including the eventual failure or success of the test as well as the location of the report generated by the test - is displayed on screen.
  
    
    

```

Test-CsReplica -Verbose
```


### Example 2

Example 2 is a variation of the command shown in Example 1. In this case, however, the Report parameter is included in order to specify a folder path and name for the report generated by the test. If you do not specify a report path the report will be given an auto-generated name similar to this:

```
Test-CsReplica -Verbose -Report C:\\Logs\\ReplicaTest.html
```


## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The **Test-CsReplica** cmdlet verifies that the Skype for Business Server 2015 replica service is running on the local computer. The **Test-CsReplica** cmdlet performs such tasks as: checking the status of the Replicator Agent and Centralized Logging Agent services; verifying that the required ports have been opened in the Windows Firewall; and ensuring that the necessary Active Directory and local computer security groups exist.
  
    
    
Note that this cmdlet must be run locally; that is, it must be run on the same computer where the replica service is running. There are no options for running the **Test-CsReplica** cmdlet against a remote server.
