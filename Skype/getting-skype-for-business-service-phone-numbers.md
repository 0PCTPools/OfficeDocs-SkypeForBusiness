# Getting Skype for Business service phone numbers

In addition to getting phone numbers for individual users from Office 365, it's also possible to search and acquire toll or toll-free phone numbers for services such as dial-in conferencing (for conference bridges) and auto attendants which are called service numbers. Service phone numbers have a higher concurrent calling capacity than user or subscriber phone numbers. For example, a service number can handle 100's of calls simultaneously, whereas a user's phone number can only handle a few calls simultaneously.
  
    
    


> [!IMPORTANT]
> PSTN Consumption must be set up first in order to acquire toll free numbers. 
  
    
    


You have two ways of getting service numbers so you can use them with Skype for Business:
  
    
    


- Get new numbers from Office 365 Skype for Business.
    
  
- Port or transfer your existing numbers from your service provider or phone carrier.
    
    > [!NOTE]
      > When you transfer your service numbers, it is highly recommended that you contact  [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b%28Office.14%29.aspx) to ensure the higher concurrent calling capacity is considered and configured correctly.

## Get new service numbers


1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
  
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
  
3. In the left navigation go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers** > **Add** then click **New service numbers**.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Skype for Business Cloud PBX** add-on license, or one **Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing** add-on license.
    
  
4. On the **Add new service numbers** page, use drop downs to choose:
    
  - **Country/Region**
    
  
  - **State/Region**
    
  
  - **City**
    
  
5. Under **Quantity**, enter the number of phone numbers that you want for your organization and click **Add** to create a reservation. You have 10 minutes to select your phone numbers and if you take more than 15 minutes the phone numbers will be returned to the pool of phone numbers.
    
    > [!NOTE]
      > You can see the number of phone numbers which is based on the number of licenses listed next to **Total user number your can acquire**. For details, see  [How many phone numbers can you get with Skype for Business](how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get-with-skype-for-business.md). 
6. You can click **Show numbers** to see the full list of phone numbers. This is helpful if you don't want to select a specific phone number in the list.
    
  
7. Select the phone numbers you want and then click **Acquire numbers**.
    
  

### Assign service numbers

Once you have your service numbers, they can then be assigned to a dial-in conferencing bridge. To do this, see  [Change the toll or toll-free numbers on your dial-in conferencing bridge](change-the-toll-or-toll-free-numbers-on-your-dial-in-conferencing-bridge.md).
  
    
    

### Port or transfer existing service numbers

If you want to transfer service numbers from your current service provider or carrier, you need to manually submit a port order to Microsoft. You have to submit separate port orders for each type of service number (toll vs toll-free) that you will be transferring using a Letter of Authorization (LOA). In the Letter of Authorization (LOA), you must select correct type of service number. When contacting Microsoft support, please make sure you specify that you are transferring a service number ( *and not a user or subscriber number*  ) or the concurrent calling capacity may not be enough to handle call volumes. If you want to transfer phone numbers or do other things with your phone numbers, see [Get phone numbers for Skype for Business Online](get-phone-numbers-for-skype-for-business-online.md).
