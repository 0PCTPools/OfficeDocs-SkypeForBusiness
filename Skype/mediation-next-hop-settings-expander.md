# Mediation Next Hop Settings Expander
[]
You specify the Mediation Server pool or Mediation Server next hop by selecting the defined Enterprise Edition Front End pool or Standard Edition Front End Server from the drop-down list. A Director or Director pool is not a valid selection for a Mediation Server pool or Mediation Server next hop, and will not appear in the list. Click **OK** to accept and save your changes. Click **Cancel** to discard your changes and exit the properties page.
  
    
    

For details about the settings for the Mediation Server pool or Mediation Server, see  [Deploy a Mediation Server in Topology Builder in Skype for Business Server 2015](deploy-a-mediation-server-in-topology-builder-in-skype-for-business-server-2015.md) in the Deployment documentation.
