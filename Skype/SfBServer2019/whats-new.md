## Unified messaging services

Exchange UM remains available in Skype for Business Server 2019 when you integrate Skype for Business 2019 with Exchange 2013 or Exchange 2016. Due to changes in support in Exchange 2019, Exchange UM integration is being de-emphasised in favor of Cloud Voicemail and Cloud Auto Attendant features.  See [Plan Cloud Voicemail service](hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail.md) and [Plan for Skype for Business Server and Exchange Server migration](hybrid/plan-um-migration.md) for more information.

  
## Management of on-premises servers

Skype for Business Server 2019 now allows you to forward call quality and analytics data to the Skype for Business Online Call Quality Dashboard, where you can monitor either data set from the same interface. See [Plan Call Data Connector](hybrid/plan-call-data-connector.md) for more information.
  
## Deployment and management of hybrid solutions
Skype for Business Server 2019 can integrate with Skype for Business Online or Teams, see [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Skype for Business Online or Teams](hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity.md) for more information.
