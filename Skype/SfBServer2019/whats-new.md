# What's in Skype for Business Server 2019 

**Summary:** Read this topic to learn about new features in Skype for Business Server 2019.  

[!INCLUDE [disclaimer](disclaimer.md)]

New features in Skype for Business Server 2019 include the following:
  
- Call Data connector
- Cloud voicemail
- Cloud Auto Attendant


  
New features in Skype for Business Server 2015 include improvements to:

- Manageability
- Mobile support
- Management of on-premises servers
- Deployment and management of hybrid solutions
- Multi-factor authentication support

  
## Manageability

Skype for Business Server 2019 now allows you to forward call quality and analytics data to the Skype for Business Online Call Quality Dashboard, where you can monitor either data set from the same interface. See [Plan Call Data Connector](hybrid/plan-call-data-connector.md) for more information.
  
## Unified messaging services

Due to changes in support in Exchange 2019, Exchange UM integration is being de-emphasised in favor of Cloud Voicemail and Cloud Auto Attendant features. Exchange UM remains available when you integrate Skype for Business 2019 with Exchange 2013 or Exchange 2016. See [Plan Cloud Voicemail service](hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail.md) and [Plan for Skype for Business Server and Exchange Server migration](hybrid/plan-um-migration.md) for more information.
