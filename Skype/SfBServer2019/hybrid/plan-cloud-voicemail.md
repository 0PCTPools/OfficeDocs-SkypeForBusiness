# Plan Cloud Voicemail service

[!INCLUDE [disclaimer](../disclaimer.md)]

## Overview 

This article describes benefits, planning considerations, and requirements for implementing the Microsoft Coud Voicemail service. For information on configuring Cloud Voicemail, see Configure Cloud Voicemail.

Cloud Voicemail enables all your Skype for Business 2019 users--whether they are homed on premises or online--to have access to the same voicemail service in the Microsoft Cloud. Cloud Voicemail provides the following benefits for both your on-premises and online users:

- Access to voicemail in their Exchange mailbox by using the Skype for Business Online, Teams, or Outlook clients 

- Ability to use the web-based portal to manage their voicemail options

- **WHAT ELSE?**

If you have an on-premises Skype for Business Server, Cloud Voicemail simplifies the task of maintaining a hybrid environment in which some of your users are homed on premises and some are homed online.  

Cloud Voicemail takes the place of Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) and provides much of the same functionality. **(Need specifics on Exchange UM functionality)**   

Because Exchange UM is being deprecated, if you are currently using Exchange UM, you will need to plan your migration strategy based on your current environment, version of Skype for Business and Exchange servers, and so on.  For more information about migration and interoperability, see [Plan for Skype for Business Server and Exchange Server migration](plan-um-migration.md). 

With Cloud Voicemail, your administration tasks are greatly simplified because:

- There is no need to configure the Exchange UM role.
- The setup tasks for Cloud Voicemail are simpler.
- Updates to voicemail functionality are delivered directly in the cloud, so your users always have access to the latest features and updates with less dependency on Cumulative Updates (CUs).
- You have the same set of controls for both on-premises and online users.  For more information on these controls, see 
 [Set up Phone System voicemail](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-Phone-System-voicemail-Admin-help-9c590873-b014-4df3-9e27-1bb97322a79d?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

**SPECIFICALLY, HOW IS CLOUD VOICEMAIL EASIER? HOW DOES THE CONFIG CHANGE?  DO YOU STILL NEED TO SET UP A DIAL PLAN? DOES THE SPLIT DOMAIN SETUP FOR HYBRID CONNECTIVITY TAKE CARE OF ALL SHARED SIP ADDRESS SPACE REQUIREMENTS, AND SO ON...**  

The following diagram shows Cloud Voicemail in a hybrid deployment:


![SfB Cloud Voicemail](../../sfbserver2019/media/plan-cloud-voice-mail-server1.png)

Unanswered calls are handled as follows:  

1. For users homed on premises, unanswered calls are sent by the on-premises Skype for Business Server to the online Cloud Voicemail Service. 
2. For users homed online, unanswered calls are sent directly to the online service.  
3. The Service processes the voicemail, including transcription.
4.  The Service then deposits the voicemail in the Exchange mailbox of the user, whether the mailbox is on-premises on online.  
5. Users can access their voicemail from either their Skype for Business Online, Teams, or Outlook client.

## Requirements

The following requirements assume that you already have Skype for Business Server deployed in a supported topology.  For more information about deploying Skype for Business Server and supported topologies, see INSERT LINK HERE.

- **Hybrid connectivity.**  If you already have Skype for Business Server deployed, and you want to enable Cloud Voicemail for your on-premises users, you must ensure that you have hybrid connectivity set up between your on-premises and online environments.  This is sometimes called a split domain configuration. Hybrid connectivity requires the following:

    - Azure Active Directory (AAD) Connect, which is used to synchronize your on-premises directory with Office 365. For more information, see Connect Active Directory with Azure Active Directory.

    - An Office 365 tenant with Skype for Business Online enabled.  

    - Federation enabled between your on-premises Skype for Business Server deployment and your Office 365 tenant. For more information, see [Configure federation with Skype for Business Online](configure-federation-with-skype-for-business-online.md).  

    - A shared Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) address space.  A SIP address is a unique identifier for each user on a network, similar to a phone number or an email address. For more information, see Configure federation with Skype for Business Online. 

    For more information, see [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Skype for Business Online](plan-hybrid-connectivity.md) and [Configure hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Skype for Business Online](configure-hybrid-connectivity.md)

- On-premises users must be enabled for voice and hosted voicemail in Skype for Business Server. For more information, see INSERT LINK HERE.

- **ANYTHING MISSING?**

NOTE: If you have an on-premises only deployment--that is, only Exchange and Skype for Business on-premises servers--but you want to take advantage of Cloud Voicemail, then you need the ON-PREM license.  **NEED DETAILS ABOUT THE ON-PREM-ONLY LICENSE.**

##Migration and interoperability

If you are planning to deploy Skype for Business Server 2019 and/or Exchange Server 2019, you must plan your migration carefully to ensure continued service for voice messaging.  Keep the following in mind:

- Exchange Server 2019 no longer provides Exchange UM functionality
- Skype for Business Server 2019 no longer integrates with Exchange Online UM

Version interoperability and supported topologies for Cloud Voicemail are listed in the following table.

**NOTE:**  For the preview release, Cloud Voicemail only works with Skype for Business Server and Exchange Server 2019 or Exchange Online.

NEW VERSION OF TABLE

IS THE FOLLOWING ACCURATE FOR JULY?

|                               | Exchange Server 2013 | Exchange Server 2016 | Exchange Server 2019 | Exchange Online   |
|:---------------------------    |:---------------------|:---------------------|:------------------|:---------------------- |
| Skype for Business Server 2019 | Exchange Server UM | Exchange Server UM | Cloud Voicemail | Cloud Voicemail
Skype for Business Server 2015 | Exchange Server UM | Exchange Server UM |  | Cloud Voicemail <br> Exchange Online UM* |
Lync Server 2013 <br>  | Exchange Server UM | Exchange Server UM | | Cloud Voicemail <br> Exchange Online UM* |

\* Until deprecated.

ORIGINAL TABLE

|                               | Exchange Server 2013 | Exchange Server 2016 | Exchange Server 2019 | Exchange Online   |
|:---------------------------    |:---------------------|:---------------------|:------------------|:---------------------- |
| Skype for Business Server 2019 | Exchange Server UM | Exchange Server UM | Cloud Voicemail | Cloud Voicemail
Skype for Business Server 2015 | Exchange Server UM | Exchange Server UM | Cloud Voicemail | Cloud Voicemail <br> Exchange Online UM* |
Lync Server 2013 <br>  | Exchange Server UM | Exchange Server UM |  | Cloud Voicemail <br> Exchange Online UM* |

\* Until deprecated.


Microsoft recommends the following migration paths:

- If you currently have Skype for Business Server 2015 or Lync Server 2013 using Exchange Online UM, Microsoft recommends that you migrate from Exchange UM to Cloud Voicemail first, and then migrate to Skype for Business Server 2019.  

-  If you are upgrading to Skype for Business Server 2019, you can use Exchange UM in Exchange Server 2013 or 2016, but you must upgrade to Cloud Voicemail if you are using Exchange Server 2019.

- If you are upgrading to Exchange Server 2019, and you are using previous versions of Exchange Server UM for Skype for Business Server voice messaging, you will need to configure Skype for Business Server to use Cloud Voicemail for your users prior to moving their mailboxes to Exchange Server 2019.   

- TBD

**HOW GNARLY WILL MIGRATION BE?  DO WE LINK OFF TO MORE GNARLY MIGRATION ARTICLE?**

**NEED TO EXPLAIN VARIOUS MIGRATION PATHS/SCENARIOS IN TABLE...  IF YOU ARE RUNNING EXCHANGE SERVER 2016, EXCHANGE SERVER 2019, SFB SERVER 2015, 2019, ETC.** 

**WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON MIGRATION PATHS?  NEED TO FOCUS ON DOCUMENTING THOSE FIRST.**

**ACCORDING TO ROY, FOR TAP, SFB 2015 DOES NOT WORK WITH CLOUD VOICEMAIL, SO MUST UPGRADE TO SFB 2019.  WILL 2015 WORK WITH CLOUD VOICEMAIL FOR BETA?  ROY FOLLOWING UP...**

**AT TAP, GUIDANCE IS UPGRADE TO SFB 2019 FIRST, THEN UPGRADE TO EXCHANGE SERVER 2019, THEN START MOVING USERS TO EXCHANGE SERVER 2019...WHAT IS GUIDANCE FOR BETA?  THIS DOC IS TARGETED FOR BETA**



**-------------------------------------------------**

**QUESTIONS:**

**THE GOAL OF THIS TOPIC SHOULD BE HIGH-LEVEL WITH POINTERS TO OTHER DOCS FOR DETAILS ABOUT HYBRID CONNECTIVITY, CONFIGURING VOICEMAIL, EXCHANGE UM MIGRATION, ETC.  HOWEVER, ARE WE MISSING IMPORTANT CONCEPTS AND PREREQUISITES SPECIFIC TO THIS FEATURE/SCENARIO THAT SHOULD BE DESCRIBED IN THIS DOCUMENT?**

**HOW MUCH DO WE NEED TO SAY ABOUT EXCHANGE UM IN THIS TOPIC?  WE PROBABLY WANT TO LINK TO OTHER DOCS FOR SPECIFICS ABOUT THE VARIOUS MIXED SCENARIOS AND RECOMMENDED MIGRATION PATHS. FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMER HAS SOME USERS STILL USING EXCHANGE UM ON PREM, BUT SOME USERS USING CLOUD VOICEMAIL? CUSTOMERS WHO STILL HAVE AN ONPREM PBX?  CUSTOMERS WITH MIXED VERSIONS OF SERVERS?**

**HOW LONG IS EXCHANGE UM BEING SUPPORTED?** 

**WHEN ORG AA IS READY, WE WILL UPDATE THIS DOC TO MENTION ORG AA AS WELL.  NOT CLEAR YET IF ORG AA SHOULD BE PART OF THIS DOC OR SEPARATE DOC**

**NOTE: IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOC TO DESCRIBE TAP FUNCTIONALITY.  GOAL IS BETA AT END OF JUNE, THEN UPDATE FOR GA.**
