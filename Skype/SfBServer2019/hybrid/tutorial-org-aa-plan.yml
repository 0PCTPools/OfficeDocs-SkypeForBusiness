    [Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-What-is-Skype-for-Business-3a21eca4-434d-41f1-ab06-3d4a268573b7) is a digital hub that 
    brings conversations, meetings, files, and apps together in one place. Because it’s built on Office 365, schools benefit from integration with 
    their familiar Office apps and services. It delivers enterprise-grade security and compliance that is extensible and customizable to fit any need.

    Auto attendants let people that call your business navigate a menu system to get them to the right department, call queue, person, or the operator. You 
    can create an auto attendant for your organization by using the Skype for Business admin center.
    
    Perhaps you’re employed at a small business (or an outsider on a contract) and you’ve been asked to implement an auto attendant for a small business, which 
    you may never have done start to finish. If you are asked to set up an auto attendant, this article will guide you through setting this up for a typical 
    small business.   

    We’ll be discussing:
    -	Gathering information and assessing the needs of the implementation
    -	Designing a logical nesting structure for the Auto Attendants that will meet those needs
    -	Writing the scripts for the Auto Attendants
    -	Implementing the needed Auto Attendants 

    This guide is for IT admins in small businesses, including those who are currently implementing Skype for Business Online. This guide will help 
    you get started with enabling Auto Attendants in Skype for Business for your small business.

    This guide is designed to get you started quickly with configuration recommendations specific to Skype For Business in small businesses. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but it is a good starting point. 
  
    ## Before you begin
    
    1. Create users in Skype for Business
    2. Assign Voicemail boxes to users.

    VanArsdel, Ltd. is a small town law office with three lawyers and a total of 15 employees, each of whom already has Office 365 and a Phone System 
    voicemail box.    

    The needs assessment might include the following questions:

    ## Q: Who are the people in the business?
    Here's a summary of the employees: 
    |Phone #	| Name		|Role			|Notes |
    |:--      |:--        |:--        |:--      |:--   |
    |555-0181	|Olga Gerasimova	|Lawyer | |
    |555-0182	|Manuela	Carstens|	Lawyer | |	
    |555-0183	|Andrey	Alexeeva	|Lawyer |  |	
    |555-0184	|Lena	Ehrle	|Paralegal |  |
    |555-0185	|Svetlana	Uvarova	|Paralegal | |
    |555-0186	|Sofia	Krause	|Paralegal |  |
    |555-0187	|Mariya	Artemyeva	|Paralegal  |  |

    |555-0195	|Franco	Piccio	  |Legal Records  |   |
    | | | | |  |
  
    ## Q: What Desktop devices are in use?
    Each of the lawyers has a desk phone, as do the paralegals, the office manager, investigator, receptionist, billing clerks, and the records clerk. 

    ## Q: Why are the customers calling?
    Your Auto Attendant should address the needs of the customers, and the most frequent customer needs should get addressed first. Since Julie Wolfe is 
    acting as the operator for the office until the Auto Attendant system is implemented she should be in the best position to tell you what customer 
    needs generate calls. 

    Ask her to keep a record for one week of the calls the business gets, and which extensions she transfers the calls to in response to customer inquiries. 
    Here’s what she reports back with:

    |Caller issue |	# of calls	| Operator action |
    |:--          |:--          |:--              |
    |Scheduling/rescheduling/cancelling appointments	|45|	No transfer, receptionist handles the call|
    |Billing questions	|22 |	Transfer to Jakob or Laura in Billing | 
    |Inquiry about hours and business location	|20|	No transfer, receptionist handles the call|
    |Want to speak to one of the Lawyers	|15|	Transfer to the Lawyer requested|
    |Want to speak to the office manager	|12|	Transfer to the office manager |
    |Want to speak to one of the Paralegals	|10|	Transfer to the VM for the paralegal requested|
    |Want to speak to the investigator	|6|	Transfer to the investigator |
    |Requesting a copy of records	|4|	Transfer to the records clerk |
    | | | |

    ## Q: What special considerations does each job function in the office have?
    Have some discussions with people in each of the job functions in the office about what they need from the Auto Attendant. In our small office the 
    following point was made clear:
    - Billing questions can be handled by either of the clerks. Given that, it’s okay to create a call queue with both of their numbers that will send 
    the call to whichever line is not already busy, or to a random extension if both are free. (We’re not going to implement this in the example config, 
    but it’s a situation where having a menu option go to a call queue makes sense.)

    ## Q: What language requirements do the customers have?
    Asking Julie Wolfe, we discover that there were only two callers in the whole week for whom English seemed to be a second language. They functioned 
    well enough in English to make their enquiries, and they didn’t seem to speak the same native language. Confirming this with the business partners, 
    the dentists, the need for bilingual or multilingual prompts was not seen as a priority.

    ## Q: What are the business hours, non-business hours and holidays?
    You’ll may want distinct initial greetings for business hours, weekends, holidays, after-hours, and so on.

    ## Q: For each of the job functions in the office, what issues do they handle for customers?
    You may be surprised by what issues the various office workers usually handle. For example, it’s possible that Julie the receptionist can answer many 
    questions you might have assumed should be routed to the billing department or Valeria the office manager.

    ##	General Guidelines
    Before we look at our specific example, let’s look briefly at some more general design guidelines and basics.  

    Do:
    1.	It's a good idea to have alternate initial greetings for calls taken outside business hours, or on holidays or weekends.
    2.	Put your most frequently used options as early as possible in the first set of menu options. If possible, reserve zero in the first menu for a 
    transfer to a live operator, but mention it last. 
    3.	Have the menu repeat once if nothing is selected, and if there still isn't a selection, transfer the call to a live operator rather than having 
    the call disconnect.
    4.	Use multilingual prompts, but put the secondary language or languages at the end of the first set of options. You’ll need to create a separate 
    set of nested Attendants for the secondary language.
    5.	Take a few extra minutes to flow chart the options you want to create, and make sure you aren't creating opportunities for users to go around in 
    circles in the option menus. It should ideally be possible to get connected to a person or their voicemail in three menus or less.
    Don't:
    1.	Create a nested Auto Attendant with more than 5 choices. If you do, you'll likely confuse your callers and force them to repeat the menu.
    2.	Use reserved menu option numbers or keys as menu options. If all extensions in your office start with 6, then don't use that number.  

    The \* and \# characters frequently have reserved meanings too, so review which DTMF keys are reserved.

 
 

- title: Do a Design Mockup 
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    To do the initial design, you'll need a flexible and easy way to work out hierachies and structures of users and Auto Attendants. Here’s an exercise you 
    can do on any blank wall or whiteboard, using several colors of pen and some sticky notes or index cards and tape:
    1.	For each person with a voicemail account in the business, write their name and phone extension on a sticky note or 3x 5 index card. You may need 
    several notes for the employee who will be the Operator. If you have several colors of note available, it might help to distinguish users and menus at a glance.
    2.	Mark one note as the main initial greeting, another as the after hours or holiday greeting (you could easily choose to separate these, but for now we’ll 
    merge them), one to represent the hours and location recording (if you’re choosing to use one), and one to stand in for the main Auto Attendant, which presents 
    the first three to five most-used options. If possible, use a different color of note.
    3.	Place the initial greeting on your board space, then below it place the main auto attendant note. If any of the top options go directly to a single employee, 
    put their note to the right of the note representing the attendant. 
    4.	It’s unlikely all the options will fit on a single attendant menu, so think about which additional attendants might be needed and how they might nest under 
    each other and under the main attendant.  
    5.	If you have an option that leads to a call queue, create a note using a third color, place it below and to the right of the Attendant that connects to 
    it. Place notes representing the users in the queue to the right of the note representing the queue.

    ### Writing Better Auto Attendant Scripts 
    Your auto-attendant script can make or break the impression left on your customers or callers. Think it through carefully, write it out, and consider having it professionally recorded.
    Consider some of these guidelines when planning a brand new auto attendant system:
    Do:
    1.	Greet and thank the caller for contacting you. Keep this short, no more than three sentences and under 30 seconds. If your web site offers self-service 
    options, mention it but otherwise present choices and options as soon as possible without being abrupt.  It's a good idea to have alternate initial greetings 
    for calls taken outside business hours, or on holidays or weekends.
    2.	Put your most frequently used options as early as possible in the first set of menu options. If possible, reserve zero in the first menu for a transfer 
    to a live operator, but mention it last. 
    3.	Use multilingual prompts, but put the secondary language or languages at the end of the first set of options.
    4.	Present the option, then the number to press ("For Sales, press 3"). When the caller hears the option they want, their attention immediately focuses, so 
    that's the time to tell them what will get them there.
    5.	Choose the person reading your script carefully, make sure their voice leaves the impression you want and their voice is clearly understandable when 
    recorded. If the reader mumbles, sounds condescending, or sounds like they might be a machine, you can probably find a better choice.
    6.	Mention significant changes to your option structure when that happens, but don't leave that part of the greeting active for more than a month. If you 
    have frequent updates and expect that to be the case most of the time, just omit it from the script.
    
    Don't:
    1.	Clutter the initial greeting with hours of operation or your business address. Make those available as a choice in the first menu if it's frequently requested information, but keep the initial greeting short and sweet.
    2.	Create menus with more than 5 choices. If you do, you'll likely confuse your callers and force them to repeat the menu.
    3.	Say please or use other pleasantries over and over. Just get the callers to the option or person they need as efficiently as possible.
    4.	Include "http:\/\/www\." when mentioning a web address. It's just a poor use of script time.
    5.	Use abbreviations like St for street or CA for California. Spell them out in the script and say the whole word in the recording. 
    6.	Use reserved menu option numbers or keys. If all extensions in your office start with 6, then don't use that number.  The * and # characters frequently have reserved meanings too, so review which DTMF keys are reserved.
    7.	Include sales information in the scripts, you'll annoy your callers. Let your sales force take care of that sort of thing.

    And finally, if your company has a slogan, think twice about including it in the script at all. Chances are your callers have heard it before if they're calling 
    you. If you do include it, put it somewhere it brings the Auto Attendant experience to a close, like when transferring to an individual's desk line or voicemail. 
    If you’ve had a slogan or tag line for a long time that many of your customers know, it might or might not be worth including.

    The following implementation uses text-to-speech for the scripts, but you can of course record custom .wav files for your scripts. The information for the 
    options is presented in the tables that follow.

    Your account must have Admin priveleges: in the **Skype for Business admin center**, click **Call routing** > **Auto attendants**, then click **Add new**.
    The following tables show values to enter in the user interface screens. Each table represents a user interface screen.
