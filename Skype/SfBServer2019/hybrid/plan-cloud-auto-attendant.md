# Plan cloud auto attendant

## Feature Overview 
This feature enables the use of the existing Cloud PBX Auto Attendant Service as an intuitively, natively integrated solution for Skype for Business Server. 

An Admin is able to: 

* Create a Cloud PBX Auto Attendant.
* Extract and dump an existing Exchange UM Auto Attendant configuration to serve as background information in creating a new Cloud PBX Auto Attendant. 
* Define routing of inbound PSTN calls that arrive on a local (on-prem) trunk, gateway/SBC and Mediation Server and must be routed to an instance of the Auto Attendant service in the cloud. 
* Access reporting and other service information.
