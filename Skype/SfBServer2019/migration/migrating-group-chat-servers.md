# Migrating Group Chat servers
[]
If you deployed Group Chat Server in your legacy Lync Server 2010 environment, you must deploy Lync Server 2013 Persistent Chat Server. Group Chat Server and Persistent Chat Server can coexist, but content (for example, chat rooms, etc.) is not shared across these servers. To access the legacy Group Chat Server content from Persistent Chat Server, you must migrate the Group Chat Server to Persistent Chat Server. For details on migrating to Persistent Chat Server, see 
<!-- [Migration from Lync Server 2010, Group Chat or Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Group Chat to Lync Server 2013, Persistent Chat Server](../../migration/migration-group-chat/migration-from-lync-server-2010-group-chat-or-office-communications-server-2007.md) in the Migration documentation.  -->
