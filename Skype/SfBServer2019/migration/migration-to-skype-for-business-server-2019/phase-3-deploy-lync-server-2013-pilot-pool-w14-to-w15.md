description: "This section covers the steps required to deploy a pilot pool of Lync Server 2013. The deployment of Lync Server 2013 requires using Topology Builder to define your topology and the components you want to deploy, preparing your environment for deployment of the Lync Server 2013 components, publishing your topology design on the first Front End Server, and then installing and configuring Lync Server 2013 software for the components for your deployment. When completed, your Lync Server 2013 pilot pool deployment will coexist with an existing Lync Server 2010 pool."

# Phase 3: Deploy Lync Server 2013 pilot pool [W14 to W15]
[]
This section covers the steps required to deploy a pilot pool of Lync Server 2013. The deployment of Lync Server 2013 requires using Topology Builder to define your topology and the components you want to deploy, preparing your environment for deployment of the Lync Server 2013 components, publishing your topology design on the first Front End Server, and then installing and configuring Lync Server 2013 software for the components for your deployment. When completed, your Lync Server 2013 pilot pool deployment will coexist with an existing Lync Server 2010 pool.
