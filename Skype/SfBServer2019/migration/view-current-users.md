# View current users in legacy pool

Prior to learning the various ways you can move users between pools, we must first determine what users exist in the legacy pool. In the image below, the Registrar pool column identifies six users who are configured for the legacy pool. These are the test users we will move to the Skype for Business Server 2019 pool.
  
### To see the list of users in the legacy pool

1. Log on to the legacy Front End Server with an account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group or a member of the CsAdministrator or CsUserAdministrator administrative role.
    
2. Open **Skype for Business Server Control Panel**.
    
3. Click **Users**, click Search, and then click **Find**.
    
**The Skype for Business Server Control Panel**
