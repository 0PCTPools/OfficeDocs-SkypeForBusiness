# View current users in Lync Server 2010 pool
[]
Prior to learning the various ways you can move users between pools, we must first determine what users exist in the legacy Lync Server 2010 pool. In the image below, the Registrar pool column identifies six users who are configured for the legacy Lync Server 2010 pool. These are the test users we will move to the Lync Server 2013 pool.
  
### To see the list of users in the Lync Server 2010 pool

1. Log on to the Lync Server 2010 Front End Server with an account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group or a member of the CsAdministrator or CsUserAdministrator administrative role.
    
2. Open **Lync Server Control Panel**.
    
3. Click **Users**, click Search, and then click **Find**.
    
**The Lync Server 15 Control Panel**
