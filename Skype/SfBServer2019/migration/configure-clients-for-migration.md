# Configure clients for migration
[]
This topic contains the recommended client deployment steps you should take before migrating to Lync Server 2013. These configuration changes should be made on Lync Server 2010.
  
### To configure clients before migration

1. Deploy the most recent server, client, and device updates (hotfixes) for existing installation.
    
2. On Lync Server 2010, use Client Version Filtering to only allow clients with the most current updates installed.
