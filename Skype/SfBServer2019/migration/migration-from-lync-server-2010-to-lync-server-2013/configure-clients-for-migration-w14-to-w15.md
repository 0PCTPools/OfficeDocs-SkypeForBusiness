# Configure clients for migration [W14 to W15]
[]
This topic contains the recommended client deployment steps you should take before migrating to Lync Server 2013. These configuration changes should be made on Lync Server 2010.
  
### To configure clients before migration

1. Deploy the most recent server, client, and device updates (hotfixes) for Lync Server 2010. For the most up-to-date information about Lync Server 2010, see Updates Resource Center for Lync at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=232630](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=232630).
    
2. On Lync Server 2010, use Client Version Filtering to only allow clients with the most current updates installed.
