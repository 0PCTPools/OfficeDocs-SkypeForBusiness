# Search for phone numbers for users

When you are setting up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must use the **Skype for Business admin center**and first get phone numbers that can be assigned to users. The phone number you assign to a user will be a phone number that you have chosen for your organization and will be listed in the drop-down list when you edit the properties of the user and click **Assign number**.
  
    
    

Before you can assign phone numbers to your users, you must use the **New numbers** page to search for numbers that are available for you within an area. You can search by **Country/region**, **State** and **City** and then enter the number of phone numbers you will need for your users.â€¯
