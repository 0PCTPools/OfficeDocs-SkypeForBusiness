# Turn on or off entry and exit announcements for meetings

When you are setting up dial-in conferencing in Skype for Business Online, you will receive phone numbers and what is called a dial-in or audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers. 
  
    
    

The conferencing bridge answers a call for a user that is dialing into a meeting using a phone. The conferencing bridge answers the caller with voice prompts from an auto attendant and then depending on your settings can play notifications, ask callers to record their name and sets up the PIN security. A PIN is given to a meeting organizer that allows them to start a meeting. You can however, set it so that a PIN isn't required to start a meeting.
## Setting meeting join options


1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
  
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
  
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation go to **Dial-in conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge settings**.
    
  
4. Under ** Meeting join experience** > check or uncheck **Enable meeting entry and exit notifications to be turned on** This is selected by default. However if you uncheck it, users that have already joined the meeting won't be notified that someone enters or leaves the meeting
    
  
5. After you make your changes, click **Save**.
